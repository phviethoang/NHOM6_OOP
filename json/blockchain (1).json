    "detailContent": " An underground illegal online marketplace that contained and sold sensitive information pertaining to individuals based out of the U.S. has been shut down. SSNDOB, which saw people’s names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth being collected and sold, has been successfully taken offline due to a joint operation from U.S. authorities and their counterparts in Cyprus. As , the marketplace itself wasn’t your run-of-the-mill operation — around 24 million individuals from the U.S. alone were affected by its illicit activity. Due to the large scope of the operation, ​​three governmental departments collaborated in shutting down SSNDOB. The FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Justice were all involved. Additional assistance from Cyprus police was also a factor in the marketplace ceasing its operations. The Department of Justice’s press release stated that more than $19 million in “sales revenue” was accumulated by the website’s owners. A total of four domains that provided hosting services for the entire SSNDOB marketplace were seized, including “ssndob.ws,” “ssndob.vip,” “ssndob.club,” and “blackjob.biz.” As for how the activities of the SSNDOB marketplace managed to go unchecked since 2015, Bleeping Computer highlights how the websites effectively evaded DDoS attacks and actions from law enforcement by supplying various mirror sites. This practice is common amongst illegal websites such as torrent services and the like. The method makes it nearly impossible to target the core operation behind the websites as there’s always a new domain that can be accessed. As a result, SSNDOB saw threat actors being able to buy “social security numbers, dates of birth, and full info of people” predominantly through Bitcoin, which is largely an unregulated currency that has become . Personal information of U.S.-based residents was up for grabs for $0.50 in some cases. Dates of birth for individuals residing in the United Kingdom were also sold on the website. According to cybersecurity firm Advanced Intel, which spoke with Bleeping Computer on the matter, a large portion of the stolen data was acquired via infiltrating healthcare and hospital systems and was subsequently utilized by cybercriminals to carry out financial fraud. “SSNDOB was one of the largest crime shops offering a collection of personally identifiable information for fraudsters and played an integral part in fraud schemes The majority of the customers used the shop data for various types of scams from tax to bank fraud,” AdvIntel CEO Vitali Kremez told BleepingComputer. “According to the few AdvIntel breach investigations, the criminals behind the shop specifically leveraged healthcare and hospital breach databases to source the supply of personal information for the fraudsters.” Elsewhere, since April 2015, blockchain analysis company Chainalysis detailed how they discovered $22 million in Bitcoin transactions going directly to SSNDOB. Certain transfers equalled $100,000 in Bitcoin; Bleeping Computer aptly points out that this tidbit indicates how cybercriminals bought data in bulk.",

    "title": "The last Nvidia GPUs have been cracked by crypto miners | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " It was recently confirmed that Nvidia’s crypto mining limiter for the majority of its RTX 30 cards . Now, the last two remaining boards that were stuck at 50% mining performance have now been cracked as well. NiceHash, which introduced the 100% crypto mining tool for Nvidia GPUs, has revealed that it has managed to unlock 90% mining performance for LHRv3 (Light Hash Rate version 3) boards. As , NiceHash has released the hash rate unlock for the RTX 3050 8GB and RTX 3080 12GB variants. The QuickMiner application will push said GPUs to 90% mining performance as opposed to the 100% Ethereum (ETH) mining unlocker it launched for the rest of the RTX 30-series lineup. A reason was not provided as to why a full 100% unlock could not be achieved, but 90% is still a marked improvement from the official 50% cap Nvidia imposed for LHRv3-based models. Other  that come with Light Hash Rate version 2, however, can  to crypto miners, including the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Apart from the 90% unlock for LHRv3 GPUs, NiceHash QuickMiner version 0.5.4.2 RC features “major stability improvements” — you’ll need Nvidia driver version 512.15 or higher to run the program. Tom’s Hardware highlights how Nvidia introduced LHR algorithms in February 2021 amid a market where crypto miners (due to the unprecedented cryptocurrency boom) depleted almost all of the existing stock for RTX 30 boards. The RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti, and 3060 boards in particular were launched with a LHRv2 mining limiter. As for the GeForce RTX 3050 8GB and RTX 3080 12GB models that hit the market during 2022, these video cards came with an updated, harder-to-crack LHRv3 algorithm. Crypto miners were already generating substantial amounts of profit at the height of the crypto bubble in recent years by mining ETH on Nvidia GPUs. However, the cryptocurrency market was recently , which saw some of the most stable, popular coins (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) being subjected to astronomical drops. The current freefall of the crypto market has been at the forefront of technology and finance news stories as of late. The volatility of the space has seen crypto miners rethinking their approach for generating meaningful returns from their operations. Many point toward the crypto crash of 2018, which rebounded in 2020 in spectacular fashion, as a reason why the crypto community shouldn’t be worried. Others assert that this crash will be the end of crypto currency as we know it. Whatever the case may be, it’s not a particularly good time to be a crypto miner at the moment. Why? Tom’s Hardware pointed out the profitability of mining Ethereum, and it paints a bleak picture indeed: Mining on a card like the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, even at 100%, would return around $3.50 every day. In other words, you’d have to wait nearly a year to just cover the cost of the board, let alone make a profit. Who knows where the crypto market will be in a year’s time? As such, it’s a massive risk to invest into any RTX 30 board right now with the sole intention of mining ETH. The situation may not affect mining farms as much as individual miners, though. These groups  in a single day by mining. Finally, the crypto-mining community will inevitably be worried about the impending launch of , which will effectively disable the ability to mine the coin on Nvidia-powered boards. Still, the aforementioned state of affairs has at least contributed to one positive piece of news — the , leading to availability and prices returning to pre-pandemic levels across the board .",

    "detailContent": " GameStop is adding another arm to its struggling business model. The company is getting into NFTs. GameStop seems to be the last place people think would want to sell . But when other gaming companies like Square Enix and Ubisoft jumped on the controversial blockchain bandwagon, it made sense for the video game retail chain to join the trend. The company posted a  on the official GameStop NFT account on Thursday with only two letters: “gm!” It’s obviously an acronym for “good morning,” but it’s the first (and so far only) tweet posted on the page since it went live in March. The simple tweet is already igniting controversy among fans who don’t want to see it saturate the gaming industry with more blockchain technology. However, the tweet served a dual purpose: It both signaled GameStop’s stock market win with a 3.45% increase earlier in the day, according to , and teased its NFT marketplace. GameStop’s NFT marketplace is a platform for in-game digital assets that is built into an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency platform called Immutable X in order to sell the NFTs for a low price. It was slated to launch by the end of July, but Robbie Ferguson, the co-founder of Immutable X, indicated last month that it may launch four to eight weeks sooner, which puts the date somewhere between June 1 and June 3o. Robbie Ferguson has tweeted that 4 major marketplaces are integrating with  in the next 8-12 weeks. If one of those is GameStop NFT, this would place a launch date between June 1st and June 30th, 4-8 weeks sooner than ’s launch deadline of July 31st, 2022.  \u0026mdash; GMEdd.com (@GMEdd)  This news comes just as GameStop found itself embroiled in a legal labor scandal.  reported that a former GameStop worker filed a class-action lawsuit against the company for allegedly violating New York labor law. The suit claims that GameStop paid him and other employees every two weeks instead of weekly as required by  since 25% of their job requires manual and physical labor.",

    "title": "Crypto is crashing, and that may make GPUs more affordable | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrencies big and small are having a rough time right now, with unprecedented drops and losses that may take a while to bounce back. Seeing as  prices are often affected by thet, can we expect to see an improvement in the state of the ? The crypto market is  on the best of days, but the past week or so has been one of the hardest the cryptocurrency world has ever seen. After the high peaks of November 2021, the major cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin and Ethereum — both took a really heavy blow. As usual, such blows echoed throughout the whole market, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a coin that hasn’t been hit. As a result of this crash, around $800 billion in market value has disappeared from cryptocurrency assets,  reports. It’s no mystery that graphics card pricing is a delicate matter these days. With the ongoing GPU shortage and the supply issues that come with it, it certainly doesn’t help that cryptocurrency miners tend to buy out suitable GPUs en masse for the purpose of mining. However, as the prices of crypto plummet, we are likely to see the shockwaves reach the  market shortly. For those wanting to buy a graphics card, the stars may be about to align. We have Nvidia and AMD soon about to release their next-gen graphics cards, which — at least in theory — should affect the pricing of the cards that are out on the shelves right now. Intel is also set to release new GPUs, but with  and the fact that they won’t be able to compete with next-gen Nvidia and AMD offerings, that will only have an effect on the midrange and entry-level sections of the market. In times of shortage, PC buyers have had to deal with GPUs that sell out quickly, and if they’re in stock, they’re overpriced. Crypto mining certainly plays a part in that. With the cryptocurrency market in its current state, mining will become much less profitable, and the cost of a GPU and the upkeep of a mining farm may not be worth the money and the trouble under these circumstances. Ethereum is also set to move to a proof-of-stake model soon, although that’s a bit of a . If and when that happens, it will be another nail in the coffin for crypto mining. As the demand for mining cards drops, the supply for regular users will naturally rise. A lot of used cards may also re-enter the market. However, the crypto market will, in all likelihood, recover sooner or later, and then we might see GPU pricing go up again. It all depends on the supply. It’s important to note that the financial market as a whole has been experiencing the signs of a so-called bear market for a while now, so things have been tough for crypto over the past few weeks as is. However, this gigantic crash brought Bitcoin to a current low of $28,000, which is less than half of its value in November ($67,000 at its peak), and caused Ethereum to plummet to under $2,000 for the first time in almost a year. It all started with the destabilization of something referred to as a “stablecoin” called TerraUSD. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a fiat currency, meaning they are supposed to maintain a similar value to that of a non-digital currency. In the case of TerraUSD (UST), unsurprisingly, it was supposed to be tied to the U.S. dollar. Unlike other stablecoins, UST used another cryptocurrency, Luna, to maintain its dollar peg. When the value of Luna mysteriously fell by a staggering amount, dropping from $116 in early April down to less than a dollar as of right now, it dragged TerraUSD down with it. At its lowest point, TerraUSD dropped to 30 cents. Keep in mind that it’s supposed to retain a similar value to the U.S. dollar, so going down from roughly $1 to $0.30 is a massive drop for a currency that is often seen as a safe way to store money without exposing yourself to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. In order to salvage it, the creator of TerraUSD spent around $3.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. With such a massive amount of money suddenly entering the market, the value of Bitcoin itself crashed. We are still in the early days of this latest crypto crash, and it’s worth remembering that even though cryptocurrencies are struggling, the GPU shortage is affected by more than just a high demand from crypto mining. However, since we have been seeing improvements across the board, and with next-gen cards on the horizon, it might soon be a good time to start checking out some of the .",

    "detailContent": " The Lite Hash Rate (LHR) algorithm that limits the  of certain Nvidia RTX 30 graphics cards has been completely cracked. NiceHash confirmed they’ve developed a workaround that allows you to mine the Ethereum coin on GPUs without any of the . As , NiceHash is the company behind the QuickMiner software and Excavator miner. Other individuals and groups have naturally tried to evade the LHR cap on Nvidia GPUs with their own software. For example, Tom’s Hardware points out one named NBMiner, which was able to unlock up to 70% performance. However, an application that offered 100% ETH crypto mining capabilities has yet to materialize. Until now. Tom’s Hardware said they tested NiceHash’s latest QuickMiner version, and have confirmed that it does indeed unlock 100% Ethereum mining performance for several Nvidia RTX 30-series video cards. At the moment, QuickMiner provides support for the DaggerHashimoto (Ethash) algorithm, which is said to be compatible with nearly all Ampere-based Nvidia GPUs. However, you won’t be able to receive 100% performance from both the GeForce RTX 3050 and GeForce RTX 3080 12GB models. Tom’s Hardware attributes this particular restriction to the reported implementation of an updated LHR algorithm (LHRv3) for both these boards. In any case, Tom’s Hardware tested the program on the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition and found it to “quickly” exceed the 100 megahashes per second (MH/s) mark. Comparatively, the website said the LHR limit that was previously in place would deliver a maximum of 77 MH/s. Theoretically, NiceHash reckons crypto enthusiasts could push the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti LHR rate to about 120 MH/s, although that would require applying huge overclocks — this could potentially prove to be unstable and dangerous if you’re not familiar with the process. The website’s sample was a Founders Edition version of the GPU, and it stressed that making the GDDR6X memory reach 110 degrees Celsius was understandably not a scenario it was willing to entertain. However, by utilizing QuickMiner’s “Medium” optimization setting, it was able to extract a “steady hash rates of around 108 to 110 MH/s – still at 108 degrees Celsius on the GDDR6X, incidentally.” Previously, someone released a tool that claimed to bypass mining limits on Nvidia GPUs, but that was immediately . Meanwhile, LAPSUS$, the group , stated that it had managed to locate the algorithm responsible for LHR limitations. However, it was . Let’s hope no one took them up on that offer. When considering the fact that the GPU industry has started to normalize, consumers may be wondering if the software will have an adverse effect on the market — will there be another shortage? Are prices about to start rising? The short answer? Not really. Tom’s Hardware highlights how profitability, at current rates for Ethereum, on a powerful card like the 3080 Ti would only generate around $3.50 on a daily basis. As a result, it would take a crypto-miner nearly a year to simply break even and just recuperate the cost of the GPU itself. While the appetite for crypto mining remains strong, those who are making meaningful profits from the space are largely  that can afford to pay for hundreds of Nvidia GPUs and the associated electricity bills that come with running such rigs. However, these groups will have to take a huge risk if they decide to invest in these Nvidia GPUs due to the looming prospect of the Proof of Stake (PoS) concept, which would disable the ability to mine ETH on . Whether PoS comes to fruition in the near future is .",

    "title": "Why crypto\u0027s eco-friendly pivot is perpetually delayed | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrency’s ecological woes are no secret. As  (non-fungible tokens) exploded in early 2021, so did the conversation about how much energy goes into a single transaction on the blockchain. There’s no shortage of examples illustrating the blockchain’s enormous energy consumption either: A single transaction on Bitcoin’s network consumes as much energy as a U.S. household , and the annual existence of Ethereum has a comparable carbon footprint to the . Cryptocurrency has even been reported to be the reason for  and   where clusters of miners and machinery are located. One of the main reasons that crypto gobbles up so much power is the underlying  that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other blockchains used to validate transactions: A system called proof of work (PoW). Essentially, in PoW networks, cyrptocurrency miners compete in a guessing competition for who gets to mine the next block. More computational power equals more chances to win, which effectively incentivizes more energy consumption. Crypto users and critics alike generally acknowledge that PoW is not environmentally sustainable. Because of this, many NFT artists often projects, while some legislators use crypto’s emissions as just . However, a common refrain among crypto enthusiasts when confronted with the industry’s environmental impact is to point to the momentum in upgrading popular networks to a different consensus mechanism called proof of stake (PoS). Unlike PoW, PoS doesn’t require miners to have massive amounts of computational power, yet is still capable of validating transactions. But moving onto a PoS network won’t be easy. For example, Ethereum’s move from PoW to PoS has been  and has faced repeated delays. Cryptocurrency is founded on the principle of being decentralized — meaning there is no one person, company, or figure authorizing the blockchain or how it operates. So despite the fact that most of the blockchain/crypto community are in favor of making the switch to a more sustainable consensus mechanism, it still hasn’t happened. “Once you launch on proof of work, moving away from it is a lot harder than starting out on something that is a lot more environmentally friendly,” Alex de Vries, founder of , which tracks “unintended consequences of digital trends,” said. “Changing stuff in a blockchain-based system is tremendously difficult, not so much because it’s technically difficult, but the complexity is the fact that nobody is in charge of these systems.” So what is the difference between PoW and PoS? Both algorithms are a way to decide on who gets to create the next block for the blockchain — an essential part of the blockchain system (hence, its namesake). What both PoS and PoW networks are attempting to do is force a completely random selection among its participants (miners). Randomness is key to preventing fraud, as well as a key element in decentralized finance. In PoW, miners are basically playing a big guessing game — generating billions of different number variations in the hopes of getting lucky and guessing the right one. If you guess right, you get to create the next block for the blockchain, and receive a reward for doing so. The more computational power a miner has, the bigger chance you have of winning the chance to create the next block. This is why there’s been a large centralization of physical machine equipment in places like , and . Whereas in PoS, winning doesn’t depend on computational power. Miners still have to make the right guess to be chosen to create the next block, though. To be a validator in a PoS network, you first need to acquire some kind of coin — the cryptocurrency of your chosen network. So, if Ethereum was on a PoS network, a miner would have to acquire some Ether. You’d then put your coins at stake, as collateral to play the guessing game. Then the algorithm randomly picks a participant out of the pool to create the next block. The key difference is that, in this system, the more money you have at stake, the better your chance of winning. That’s where the energy consumption differs. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that the network’s move to PoS will result in a . The blockchain is meant to be difficult. The more users, validators, and miners there are on a blockchain network, the more robust it is. This is why executing networkwide upgrades is difficult, but it’s what also makes attacking the system difficult And despite Ethereum’s goal to move to PoS by the end of the year, it’s not up to the network to make those decisions. “Every participant in this network needs to individually decide whether or not they want to run this upgrade, that’s where the main complexity is, it’s more of a social thing than a technological thing,” de Vries said. “The whole technology exists on the basis that nobody is supposed to be in charge — if someone is in charge, it’s not a blockchain.” Aligning the entire Ethereum community to upgrade its software to PoS is the main challenge facing the platform. Some validators and miners may refuse to upgrade, de Vries said, because they could lose their source of income. Crypto evangelists, or purists, may stick with PoW as well, as many consider it “the only way to go” for security purposes, according to  co-founder Damien Schuster. “The volume of activity from Ethereum wasn’t expected to grow as fast as it did,” he added. “You know the kind of saying, ‘No one goes there because it’s always busy’? That’s the Ethereum network.” If not everyone is on board, or if there is not a among users to upgrade software, platforms have been known to split off (for example, , as well as ), which may be imminent for Ethereum’s upcoming merge. But some users are optimistic. Digital artist William Murphy () believes the community is “enthusiastic” about the change and believes “this year will actually finally be the year.” “Proof of stake has always been the plan and anyone that’s an Ethereum enthusiast is generally all for it,” he said. “I think the only people that have been pushing back on it are the people that are Bitcoin maximalists that sway way towards the side of decentralization at any cost. The ecological advantages and, to be honest, financial advantages make too much sense to think that proof of work would still be the move.” For crypto users keen to keep their carbon footprint low, de Vries suggests using platforms that started out on PoS networks instead (of which there are plenty). Linda Lu, head of ecosystem at , believes the barrier of entry for PoS networks is a lot lower and “highly scalable” compared to PoW — allowing for faster transactions and lower “gas” fees (the fees it costs to process transactions on blockchain). Oasis is a “privacy-enabled blockchain” platform with dual consensus layers, and has operated on a proof-of-stake network since launching in 2018. Its native coin, the Rose token, is a fixed-capped currency for “transaction fees, staking, and delegation” and touches the Ethereum network. For platforms like Oasis, sustainability was at the forefront of its mission since day one. “Every technology has its own journey,” Lu said. “Over the past decade, we were still at the early stage of this industry where we were just waking up to what is blockchain and digging into the gold mine to see opportunities. Stage one, you recognize this thing is good. And stage two is how do we continue to have this good thing before we make some irreversible damage with this technology?” Lu thinks the industry is currently entering stage two — understanding the impact of crypto while still spreading the message of the blockchain to the mainstream. “Just because proof of stake has proven to be the most scalable and sustainable consensus mechanism now, doesn’t necessarily mean there will be no other network that can beat proof of stake in the future,” she said. “That’s the beauty of the industry.” Until Ethereum makes the switch to a more eco-friendly network, NFT artists and crypto users continue to make carbon offsetting part of their decentralized finance routines, according to Schuster. Offsetra, and its carbon calculator project , have grown substantially in the last year, alongside the NFT boom, as has the carbon market. “In conjunction with explosive crypto growth, the voluntary carbon market, which when most companies make carbon offset pledges, they’re working in that space, also exploded,” Schuster said. “The price of offsets is going up, so companies that once perhaps might have been able to buy a lot of really cheap offsets and make offset claims, well, now that’s five times more than they would pay. So that puts direct pressure on them to directly reduce their own emissions.” Who is responsible for cryptocurrency’s emissions and energy usage is a point of contention and consideration among NFT artists. Many see the space as an opportunity to make money from their art, some for the very first time, like Murphy, but against their audience’s ecological values. This is why Schuster argues anyone interested in dabbling in the blockchain should just go for it. “Whether or not you launch your NFT project or not, Ethereum’s emissions are probably going to be the same,” he said. “So if your project can raise money for climate finance to buy offsets, or donate to an organization, or fund people’s livelihood, I’d say it’s worth the expenditure. It’s kind of like buying a ticket for an airplane. It’s still going to take off whether you’re on it or not.”",

    "detailContent": " The U.S. Department of the Treasury managed to track down the culprit of the massive Axie Infinity cryptocurrency heist. It turns out that a North Korean hacker group called Lazarus stands behind the theft, which amounted to over $600 million worth of crypto being stolen. In response to the theft, the group involved had been added to the U.S. international sanctions list. THREAD: Updates to OFAC’s SDN designation for Lazarus Group confirm that the North Korean cybercriminal group was behind the March hack of Ronin Bridge, in which over $600 million worth of ETH and USDC was stolen. \u0026mdash; Chainalysis (@chainalysis)  The attack took place in March of this year and it targeted Axie Infinity, a -based game that involves cryptocurrency transactions. Although the game is based on Ethereum, it utilizes a blockchain called Ronin. This allows the players to perform all the necessary transactions without paying the hefty fees of the standard  blockchain. The two chains are connected by a digital bridge. It’s a helpful workaround for day-to-day users, but unfortunately, an exploit in the bridge between Ethereum and Ronin resulted in a massive theft. The hack conducted by the Lazarus Group resulted in 173,600 Ethereum and 25.5 million USDC being stolen. USDC is a so-called stable coin, which means it’s pegged to the U.S. dollar. At the time of the theft, the two currencies pooled together amounted to over $600 million. Initially, it was unclear whether the  referred to the Axie Infinity heist specifically. However, the Department of the Treasury confirmed to  that the new entry refers to the hack conducted by Lazarus. The cryptocurrency wallet that collected the stolen funds was discovered by the FBI as part of an ongoing investigation of North Korea. Lazarus is a state-sponsored group of hackers, and this isn’t the first time we’ve heard about their attacks. According to Chainalysis, the group stole at least $400 million worth of digital assets in 2021. However, this means that the 2022 Axie Infinity hack is a huge escalation, seeing as the group managed to steal over $600 million in one go. The funds obtained through these crypto attacks are most likely used to fund North Korea’s weapon programs. Elliptic, a cryptosecurity firm, estimates that the country has already laundered 18% of the $600 million Lazarus managed to obtain. An anonymous FBI representative said to PC Gamer: Through our investigation, we were able to confirm Lazarus Group and APT38, cyber actors associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), are responsible for the theft of $620 million in Ethereum reported on March 29th. The FBI, in coordination with Treasury and other U.S. Government partners, will continue to expose and combat the DPRK’s use of illicit activities — including cybercrime and cryptocurrency theft — to generate revenue for the regime.” This is a huge hit for Axie Infinity, a game that relies on helping users profit rather than just to have fun. Sky Mavis, the developers of Axie Infinity, said that additional security measures are being added to the Ronin Bridge. Hopefully, this time around, the bridge will be secure enough to not be breached.",

    "detailContent": " A Czech VR company is devising a way for people to live on into eternity in the metaverse. The company called Somnium Space makes VR products built on the blockchain and uses  to allow people to buy virtual real estate to build/store virtual assets, including homes. According to , the company is hoping to expand beyond this space by launching a “Live Forever” mode, which allows people to create digital avatars that mimic their appearance, voice, and personality. Artur Sychov, the CEO of Somnium Space, wanted to find a way to store someone’s personality posthumously after he lost his father to cancer a few years ago. The result is an AI construct that can interact with friends and family members in a believable way — at least for a short time. As Sychov said in an interview with Vice: “You will meet the person. And you would, maybe for the first 10 minutes while talking to that person, you would not know that it’s actually AI. That’s the goal.” The company will accomplish this by collecting an extraordinary amount of data. The company will need to harvest all sorts of personal data including conversations, movements, and facial expressions. With enough data, Somnium Space hopes to create a digital avatar that can have at least a short conversation before it’s clear the person is a computer program. Having yourself recorded in this way can be pretty unsettling, especially in a time when people are more concerned about their online data and how it is used. Sychov doesn’t believe it should be a concern, though. At any time someone can opt out of the program and have the data deleted entirely. Since the company runs on the blockchain, he also believes the company’s operations are transparent and trustworthy, especially since the company  to other companies. In order for users to trust any  Company it needs to have completely transparent and understandable business model. Blockchain provides and allows exactly that. That is why we belive and build decentralized future at   \u0026mdash; Artur Sychov | Somnium Space VR ➡️  Lisbon (@ASychov)  Of course, privacy-focused companies have been caught selling data in the past. For those open to the world of blockchain and the potential of the metaverse, though, Somnium Space’s Live Forever mode is an interesting idea that shows the potential of the budding industry.",

    "title": "Online criminals stole nearly $7 billion from people in 2021 | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Online criminals successfully defrauded billions of dollars from people during 2021, as internet-related crimes became more commonplace than ever before. , the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)  details how victims saw $6.9 billion being stolen as a result of a variety of successful online scams.  is also available. There were a record 847,376 complaints of internet crime last year, representing a 7% increase from 2020. However, that figure is also 81% higher than 2019, which is understandable considering the fact that the pandemic significantly impacted the amount of people being targeted. To that end, people working from home, especially those who conducted their meetings virtually, were specifically focused on by malicious threat actors. The IC3 said this led to fresh Business Email Compromise (BEC) and Email Account Compromise (EAC) schemes becoming more prevalent, as an attempt was made to “exploit this reliance on virtual meetings to instruct victims to send fraudulent wire transfers.” The report explained how exactly this specific method extracted nearly $2.4 billion from victims: “They do so by compromising an employer or financial director’s email, such as a CEO or CFO, which would then be used to request employees to participate in virtual meeting platforms. In those meetings, the fraudster would insert a still picture of the CEO with no audio, or a “deep fake” audio through which fraudsters, acting as business executives, would then claim their audio/video was not working properly. The fraudsters would then use the virtual meeting platforms to directly instruct employees to initiate wire transfers or use the executives’ compromised email to provide wiring instructions.” The most popular cyber crimes criminals used to target unsuspecting victims included , non-payment/non-delivery scams, and personal data breaches. Furthermore, among the methods that saw individuals lose the most money were business email compromise scams and investment fraud. Other crime types in 2021 that contributed to the aforementioned $6.9 billion figure consisted of: Notably, scams that were previously more widespread failed to even remotely approach some of the figures listed above. Case in point: Malware, scareware, and viruses only managed to steal $5.6 million from victims, though  had more success by extracting a total of $44.2 million, while ransomware accounted for $49.2 million in losses. Elsewhere, due to the recent emergence of cryptocurrency, 2020’s amount of $246.2 million stolen through  increased to more than $1.6 billion during 2021. In total, 32,400 crypto complaints were recorded last year. The FBI stressed that cryptocurrency has evidently developed into the preferred payment method for , ranging from tech support fraud to employment schemes and auction fraud. Moreover, the online currency platform is “extremely pervasive in investment scams, where losses can reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per victim.” Romance scams were particularly effective in the crypto space. During 2021, the FBI’s IC3 department received more than 4,325 complaints, which saw losses equaling $429 million. “The scammer’s initial contact is typically made via  and other social media sites. The scammer gains the confidence and trust of the victim, and then claims to have knowledge of cryptocurrency investment or trading opportunities that will result in substantial profits.”",

    "title": "The Interplanetary File System: A peek at the web\u0027s future | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " When you upload a file or send a tweet, your information is stashed in some corporation-owned mega data center in the middle of nowhere. The endless racks of computers in these facilities hold millions of ledgers, and with a flick of a switch, companies can censor or misuse the data. But what if instead of handing it to, say Amazon or Google, your data is broken down into pieces and scattered across the globe so that no one except you and your key — not even the government — can access it? That’s the idea behind a radical new online framework for storing data called the Interplanetary File System or IPFS. It went live a few months ago, and Skiff, an online document editor, is one of the first platforms to take advantage of it. Skiff looks and behaves like any other productivity service you may be familiar with, like Google Docs. You can create new documents, edit them together with your colleagues, and generally use it just like you would any other docs program. However, when you toggle on its IPFS switch, it stores all those documents in a way that none of its counterparts can. Unlike, for instance, Google, which would save your file in one of its storage facilities, Skiffs splits it into smaller chunks, encrypts them with your private key, and distributes them across a network of hosts. These hosts can be anywhere in the world and aren’t towering servers sitting in a freezing warehouse, but rather users like you and me with the bare essentials: A computer with enough storage space and an internet connection. So when Skiff wants to fetch your documents, it won’t need to establish a connection with a server sitting thousands of miles away — it could likely be just going a few blocks down from you. The way Skiff locates your files is also what truly sets IPFS apart from what we use now. You see, the internet we know runs on physical addresses. To load an image, this webpage, or any other piece of data, your device needs to know the coordinates of the server where that piece of data is stored. IPFS turns that setup on its head. Instead of the data’s location, its addresses point directly to the content itself. Each bit of IPFS data has a unique fingerprint. An app like Skiff takes that fingerprint and feeds it into the IPFS network, which tracks down the shortest routes to all the bits of data, and returns them. Not only is this much faster than traveling miles — often continents — to get your data, it also saves tons of bandwidth and energy. But there’s more to why IPFS has come into the picture. Since IPFS doesn’t centralize your information in servers owned by a handful of giants, it’s more resilient to , like the  from a few months ago that took down Slack and Epic Games for hours. On top of that, when you access any IPFS data, it’s cached on your devices indefinitely because you’re also acting as a host. So even in the event of a network failure or sporadic bandwidth, you should be theoretically able to continue browsing the web like normal. IPFS servers can’t suffer any large-scale data breaches either, since all the broken down bits of data are individually encrypted and are meaningless until they’re pieced together with your key and can’t be intercepted on the way over to a device. “With IPFS, there’s no single point of control and failure,” says Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave, one of the first browsers to let its users access IPFS content right from the web address bar, “so it’s impossible to shut it down.” IPFS has been only a couple of years in the making, but it draws inspiration from the same principles that spawned the internet decades ago. Back then, the U.S. Department of Defense’s objective was to build a decentralized system that could survive unforeseen events and allow peer-to-peer communication — just like how IPFS works. But when Big Tech took over, these principles were forgotten, and the power of the web was eventually concentrated into the hands of a few. IPFS revives those fundamentals with better technology. It’s part of a greater push by Silicon Valley, dubbed the “Web3” age, to yet again decentralize the web. There have been a couple of decentralized successes, such as Napster and BitTorrent, from the early web days. Daniel Erik, who researches distributed systems at the Berlin Institute of Technology, believes next-gen data networks such as IPFS “can build upon their predecessors and take advantage of technological advancements to address weaknesses.” Erik’s  found a broad range of upsides — but also a handful of challenges. Most importantly, what happens to your data if hosts back out in the future? The long-term availability of data has always been a hurdle for peer-to-peer systems, and IPFS will be no different. But its creator, Protocol Labs, has a plan to keep people invested in it: Cryptocurrency. The company intends to distribute its in-house cryptocurrency, Filecoin, to users who rent out storage space, and the hope is that once IPFS adoption picks up, Filecoin’s value will grow and be enough to attract mainstream interest. Importantly, though, Protocol Labs isn’t doing this for the crypto gains. The main goal behind IPFS is to protect the internet from aggressive and rampant online censorship. In the last few years, governments across the world have increasingly resorted to censoring the web to suppress dissent and squash uprisings. As there’s no central switch anyone can flip to boot a given piece of content off of the IPFS network, it’s better-equipped to resist censorship. In 2017, when Turkey banned Wikipedia, people were able to get it back up by , keeping it alive for the entire three years the crowdsourced website officially remained banned in the country. But what enables IPFS to be resilient against moderation could also potentially make it easier for malicious actors to hide. BitTorrent is notorious for enabling illegal file sharing via peer-to-peer networks, and experts fear IPFS could end up just being a more advanced version of it. “It is a difficult problem,” Erik told Digital Trends, but fortunately, he adds, developers are already building countermeasures to track, report, and protect copyrighted data on IPFS, which would prevent this network from turning into the kind of internet dark underbelly that BitTorrent has become. IPFS’s and Web3’s path to the mainstream will be nothing short of an uphill battle, however, as decentralized solutions face resistance from established financial institutions, governments around the world, and most of all, the large corporations that benefit from the existing Web2 model. But ultimately, platforms like IPFS make sense for end users because they are more fair and transparent. Consumer apps like Skiff could offer the momentum decentralized technologies need to attain commercial success, argues Fan Long, a computer science professor at the University of Toronto. “In a decentralized world, large corporations are losing the power they currently have,” Long adds. “Most corporations will be eventually forced to join the trend or be left out.”",

    "detailContent": " The  has released the results of the 10th annual State of the Industry survey, revealing the opinions of more than 2,700 people who work in and around games. It includes insight into how developers are responding to gaming topics like NFTs, the metaverse, and the industry’s toxicity crisis. The survey, which has been around for a decade now, is releasing its results just before this year’s GDC conference, which will take place later this year in March. The survey polls games professionals on their thoughts on everything from workplace harassment to NFTs to the emerging idea of the , and the results were enlightening. According to highlights from a GDC press release, more game studios than ever are taking steps to combat workplace toxicity. 38% of State of the Industry respondents said that their company took the initiative and “start[ed] a conversation” about how harassments and toxicity in the workplace are handled within the industry. Though the other 62% of respondents said that their company took no action, the numbers still signal that developers are thinking more about how to make their workplaces better for everyone involved, particularly in the wake of very public lawsuits at companies like . Despite the constant chatter and flow of news around cryptocurrency and , 72% of game developers said that neither they nor their studios are interested in integrating crypto payments into their games. 70% said the same of NFTs. Only 1% of respondents said that their studio currently uses either crypto or NFTs, showing that widespread adaptation within games is still a long way off. Developers seem to feel similarly about , with 83% of developers saying that they are not involved in the development of content and experiences for user-generated content platforms like  and . Content creation for these two titles is some of the more popular current expressions of the metaverse. While PC is still the most popular platform to develop for — 63% of developers are working on a PC game this past year — PlayStation is beating out Xbox as the most popular console for developers to make games for. Every year since the second year of the survey, more developers have been working on PlayStation games than Xbox titles: last year, 31% of developers were working on a  title, while 29% were working on an /S title. On the smaller side, 20% of developers were working on a Switch title, a number that’s risen significantly since the days of the Wii U and 3DS. 30% of developers were working on a game for phones or mobile devices, down from 55% in 2013. New platforms are still met with uncertainty among many developers. 47% are unsure that the  will be a viable platform in the long run.",

    "title": "Intel may be working on specialized chip for mining Bitcoin | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Bitcoin mining is a controversial topic, but it seems that Intel may join the fray by releasing a chip designed specifically for that. According to the latest rumors, Intel may be about to unveil a “Bonanza Mine” chip. The powerful chip would be used only for crypto mining and wouldn’t present any value to casual users. Often, it’s  that are associated with mining cryptocurrency. In fact, many attribute the  , in part, to Ethereum mining, as the cards sell out before any regular users can get their hands on them. However, the rumors suggest that Intel may be working on a specialized mining chip it refers to as Bonanza Mine.  has suggested that Intel may be unveiling the chip during the  (ISSCC), which will take place in February. The conference is centered around solid-state circuits and systems on a chip (SoCs.) Intel is scheduled to deliver a presentation in the Highlighted Chip Releases category, with the purpose of showing the new Bonanza Mine processor. The processor is described as an “ultra-low-voltage, energy-efficient Bitcoin (BTC) mining application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC),” and it seems like it may signal a new step into mining hardware for Intel. The company may be looking to compete against similar ASICs, such as those made by Bitmain, in a sector of the market that centers around . While it may be the graphics cards that get the bad rep, Bitcoin is usually mined on ASICs: Specialized chips designed to only perform one specific task. As companies like Bitmain have proven, ASICs are able to deliver the power required for mining at a lower cost. It’s worth noting that the cost reduction comes in the form of higher efficiency and lower power requirements of the ASICs in question. When it comes to purchasing one of them from companies like Bitmain, both the price and the delivery times are quite high. A quick glance at  shows dozens of ASICs, with some priced at well over $10,000. As Tom’s Hardware reports, Intel’s interest in Bitcoin mining is not new. The company patented a specialized SHA 256-optimized ASIC in 2018 that was aimed at mining Bitcoin. Although Intel hasn’t revealed much since then, it seems that the chip may have been in the works this whole time, and the company may be getting ready to present it. The theory that Intel may be working on Bitcoin mining hardware is given more credibility by a recent interview with Raja Koduri, Intel’s Systems and Graphics architect, senior vice president, and general manager. In a conversation with streaming personality DrLupo, Koduri talked about . He has also made mention of Intel’s plans to “share some interesting hardware” designed for more efficient blockchain validation that would come at a much lower cost. Intel will soon release its new discrete Arc Alchemist gaming GPUs. The company has made it clear that it won’t restrict mining on these cards, but it would prefer if the cards went to gamers instead of miners. However, it’s also clear that Intel may support the idea of Bitcoin mining to the point of creating specialized hardware for it. Compared to companies like Bitmain, Intel may have the upper hand when it comes to producing these specialized ASICs. While it’s unclear whether Bonanza Mine is being prepared as a product to be released to customers or not, Intel has the connections required to produce it in a more efficient (and perhaps cheaper) manner. If Intel’s plans for high efficiency and low power work out as intended, this could be a lucrative gem of a chip in a previously untapped market.",

    "title": "Should gaming embrace NFT? Both sides of the debate weigh in | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " It was the frequency of those three little letters on my Twitter feed that originally caught my eye. “NFT.” I had no idea what that was or what it meant, but it was showing up everywhere. Within days, half of my feed was either kowtowing at the feet of this new technology or heralding it as the end of civilized society as we know it. Between the praises and criticisms, I still couldn’t work out exactly what it meant. My Twitter feed is made up almost entirely of game designers, journalists, and other games-adjacent folks, so I knew it had to have some significance with games. Finding out exactly what it meant took me on an odyssey of promises, accusations, and entirely too much money. NFTs have become a hot-button topic in the last few months, due in large part to many prominent  to incorporate them into their games and IPs at large — and the resulting fan backlash. In order to understand exactly what they are, who they’re aimed at, and what picture they’re painting of gaming’s future, I did quite a bit of research and spoke to advocates on both sides of the crypto spectrum. An NFT, or , is a unique, usually digital item that can’t be substituted for anything else. This lack of substitution is ostensibly what gives them their value: Each one is unique. NFTs are purchased with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and are stored on a blockchain. They can be just about anything digital, but often take the form of art, music, videos, GIFs, or tweets. Gaming examples include property within virtual spaces, like in the “user-generated world” of , or the videos and art that Konami is selling as part of .  In essence, when you purchase an NFT using cryptocurrency, you’re purchasing a receipt that says you own a particular piece of media. “An NFT is a receipt. That’s all it is,” Doc Burford, a game developer and critic, told Digital Trends in an email interview. “[NFTs are] a receipt that says ‘you own this, but it’s not legally enforceable, and you also don’t have the rights to use it the way you would your own property.\u0027” Another prominent issue with NFTs is their ecological impact. Blockchain tech generally uses energy to process transactions, which means that a simple NFT sale can effect the environment. That’s caused many artists to eschew the technology altogether. “As more mainstream businesses start to implement blockchain technology, more are becoming better informed and aware of the dangers. … It’ll be interesting to see how better processes will be developed to minimize the carbon footprint,” Crystal Mills, an esports writer and content creator, tells Digital Trends. She pointed out that “massive corporations are also some of the biggest perpetrators of climate change and shouldn’t be ignored.” Ethereum has been promising for years that it will switch to the more eco-friendly “proof of stake” security system in order to combat emissions, but that has yet to happen. The issue is that Ethereum is a public blockchain, which means that the entire system has to “agree” to change to proof of stake from the existing system. If not, the whole thing will fall apart, which makes it difficult to adopt wide-ranging changes like an entirely new security system. So what does any of this have to do with gaming? Quite a bit due to recent announcements from several different game developers and publishers. After seeing the apparent success of many early NFTs, gaming companies want to cash in on the trend. NFT announcements have been especially common among old-guard developers like Square Enix and Konami. Square Enix, which already has the cash cow that is is interested in creating  (“You can’t make NFTs most people can afford and also have NFTs be ridiculously valuable,” argues Burford.) And Konami is selling a variety of videos and artwork of old Castlevania titles to celebrate the franchise’s 35th anniversary, though most fans made it clear that they would much rather have a new title in the series than a collection of themed NFTs. “As more mainstream businesses start to implement blockchain technology, more are becoming better informed and aware of the dangers.” Other companies have backed down on their intent to mix NFTs and gaming. After a big backlash from fans, Sega  from its intent to pursue NFTs, saying it wouldn’t use them if fans thought the company was only using them to make a profit. GSC Game World, the developer of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, originally announced plans to allow players to purchase the ability to put themselves in the game . After fans cried out, GSC Game World originally defended its plans, but ended up  out the window. It’s clear that many gamers don’t want any of the NFTs that have been dreamed up so far. What could the technology be used for in the future that players would be interested in? According to a  article from early last year, some crypto evangelists and investors believe that players will be willing to spend money on something within a game that they can resell or get investment value out of when they decide to stop playing the game. For some, the goal is for players to be able to make money alongside companies within their “walled-garden” ecosystems. “The idea of earning something digitally in-game that immediately becomes an asset outside of the game as well is really exciting,” said Mills. “We’re just now scratching the surface of [NFTs’] potential.” She says that potentially “earning something of actual value while playing a video game is awesome.” One common idea for NFTs in games is the purchase of assets like weapons and character skins that could be transferred from game to game, even if one game shuts down its servers or is no longer supported. Another idea is a one-of-a-kind record for games, which was described as an “emotional memory” in the VentureBeat article. At the end of their playthrough of a game, players could purchase an NFT that shows off what they did in the game and displays their unique path to completion. It would only hold value for the person who played the game. Players aren’t the only ones who are either hesitant or hostile about the potential inclusion of NFTs within companies’ gaming repertoires. Some game developers have been warning players and companies about the difficulties of incorporating blockchain technologies into their games. “When you insert profit motive into the game, you’re overruling fun, horror, compassion, curiosity, whatever else a game has, and you’re saying ‘you should play this because you can make money.’ You make [it] a job,” Burford says of NFT investments and crypto in games. He describes himself as a developer who likes “creating emotional experiences” for players. On his personal , he wrote a series of articles on why he refuses to put crypto elements into his own titles. He uses the example of weapons and armor that some crypto enthusiasts have raised before. Even if you own something that’s your property, like a particular virtual gun or sword, his concern is that players will feel bad if that weapon’s power is reduced or otherwise tweaked during routine game balancing. Should players be able to keep the weapon they purchased at its original state? That can lead to major balance or gameplay issues down the road. “Chaining yourself to a specific technology only limits your creativity.” Burford also explains that NFTs that can be transferred from game to game limit the kind of games a developer can create. If players purchase transferrable items, like those same weapons and armor, as NFTs, they will expect to be able to bring those items into future games. If a studio plans to make different kinds of games or experiment with genres, NFTs and permanent ownership of items make it much harder to do so due to player expectations. NFTs make player-focused design much more difficult. Despite these statements, Mills believes there’s real potential for NFTs and crypto in games. She suggested potential uses in MMOs in particular, and I can see the how that would work. Some ideas I can think of off the top of my head are one-of-a-kind cosmetics, weapons, or even experiences. All of these assets incur costs for developers, though; as a developer myself, thinking about pouring my time and energy into something that only one player will ever see or use isn’t appealing. Even after doing all of this research and parsing through these interviews, I’m still not sure what to think of NFTs and crypto in games in general, which is a testament to the incredibly mixed messaging surrounding the technology. Mills says that “we’re on the cusp of major innovation” with NFTs, but Burford insists that “chaining yourself to a specific technology only limits your creativity.” Despite the controversy, the NFT machine appears to be moving full steam ahead, with more companies announcing their intent to get into the space every month. Ultimately, it’s up to each individual player to do their research and consider the positives and negatives of potential NFT and blockchain integration into games. What’s clear is that companies’ current development, use, and promotion of NFTs isn’t working. If companies are able to find a way to create unique experiences or opportunities that are only accessible through NFTs, it’s possible that players will slowly become used to their presence, as is what happened with DLC. However, if companies continue to ignore their fans in the name of profit or “tack on NFT options in ways that aren’t going to be received well,” in Mills’ words, the integration may go much more slowly or not happen at all. Players are ensuring that their voices are heard, and some companies are listening. It remains to be seen just how games and non-fungible tokens will interact in the next few months and years, but one thing is for certain: The acronym “NFT” looks like it’s stuck on my Twitter feed for the time being.",

    "title": "Here\u0027s Why You NEED a Crypto Hardware Wallet Like Ledger | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Not your keys, not your coins. It’s an incredibly simple concept but it means everything in the world of cryptocurrency. If you store your coins on an exchange, it may seem like you own them, until you run into any number of prevalent obstacles. For example, if you try to withdraw more cryptocurrency than the platform allows — yes, there’s usually a limit — you’ll be denied. But this isn’t a problem relegated just to exchanges, it can also happen with any wallet provider that doesn’t allow you to own the private keys. Leaving them in the custody of a third party is . And that’s precisely why you need a hardware wallet, like Ledger. It is the most secure platform for all of your crypto needs, and it will keep your keys — and coins — safe. Here are just a few things that Ledger’s hardware wallets provide, beyond unmatched security: Ledger can be used to securely store all of your crypto, like a personal bank vault, locking away your private keys, which only you can access. That means you get full ownership of all your assets. But Ledger also adds some incredibly convenient functionality, making the hardware wallets more versatile than ever. You can also buy, sell, exchange, and earn crypto, securely, through a variety of providers directly via the Ledger Live app. Some examples include Wyre, Paraswap, Coinify, Changelly, and more. You can decide exactly where your crypto goes and what’s done with it. Ledger also provides access so you can manage your NFT or DeFI portfolio through other external providers, from within its application. When setting up your Ledger device for the first time, it will generate a list of 24 words, a master key, if you will. That one key rules them all, allowing you to manage all of your private keys stored on your wallet. It serves as the only backup of your crypto assets — and it’s extremely important. Your private keys remain offline, secure within the hardware wallet. Nobody can access or use the wallet — or any stored funds — besides you. The secure element inside the device is the same type of chip used in credit cards and passports. In addition, you see what you sign, meaning man in the middle attacks are not possible because you’ll need human interaction through the embedded buttons on the device. Each requested action, whether buying or lending crypto, must be verified and validated with the Ledger hardware wallet. Currently, there are two hardware wallets available through Ledger, and both include the same security standards. You can check out our direct comparison of the , or read more about each below. The Ledger Nano S is one of the best ways to hold and store your crypto. You can install three to 20 apps total, and you’ll gain access to Ledger’s desktop software. The Nano S also comes in several colors, so you can choose your favorite. The Ledger Nano X is for crypto enthusiasts with a lot to store. You can install up to 100 apps, and it supports on-the-go Bluetooth access. Sync up with your mobile device or  using Ledger’s app, to check your portfolio, trade, and more. If you want more than one device, you can also order Ledger hardware wallets in a bundle of three, or more — Ledger’s Family Pack S includes three Nano S wallets. Of course, another important aspect of using Ledger’s hardware wallet is that you gain access to the dedicated mobile or desktop app. From within the app, you can check your balance, review your portfolio, send or receive crypto, buy more, sell crypto for fiat, exchange for another currency, and more. The app is accessible online through a web browser, as well, so you can always check from a laptop or desktop if you prefer. Ledger Live is a huge part of the experience. You can easily manage your crypto, wallet, and portfolio all from one place. It’s easy, it’s safe, but most of all it’s convenient — no fumbling around with a collection of apps, exchanges, and so on. The app, combined with a Ledger hardware wallet, is a secure gateway to buy and grow your crypto portfolio.",

After a day of backlash, the game’s official Twitter posted a statement reaffirming its commitment to the project. An initial statement apologized for any miscommunications about the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  project but noted that GSC Game World was eager to “do NFT right” with the project. The tweet was deleted after about 30 minutes as it received a wave of negative backlash from Twitter users. A half-hour later, the Twitter account posted a much briefer statement canceling the project altogether. “Based on the feedback we received, we’ve made a decision to cancel anything NFT-related in ,” the tweet reads. DMarket confirmed the cancellation to Digital Trends via email.  \u0026mdash; S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

    "title": "An Amazon Crypto Scam Left Victim With a $45,000 Bill | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " What’s on your wish list this holiday season? We’d hazard a guess that it does not include a $45,000 bill caused by your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account getting hacked. Yet that’s exactly what happened to one unfortunate soul this December. Jonny Platt, founder of SEO Scout, was the unlucky recipient of this most unwelcome Christmas gift. , Platt woke up one morning to find their AWS account had been hijacked and had been mining the Monero cryptocurrency for the past several weeks. The resulting charge was that eye-watering $45,000 fee. The hack was not particularly advanced, and worked by installing a mining script that ran on the AWS Lambda platform. Every three minutes, it would install itself in a different Lambda instance and continue mining for 15 minutes at a time (the maximum allowed on Lambda). That allowed it to operate concurrently on several Lambda instances, maximizing its crypto harvesting. At least, that’s what you would think. But it turns out that all that effort — and that enormous bill Platt was faced with — only managed to mint six XMR (the code for Monero coins). The total dollar value? A paltry $800. Getting an $800 return on your $45,000 investment doesn’t exactly seem like a sound business plan. But when you’re getting someone else to foot the bill without them even realizing, problems like that don’t really matter. As Platt pointed out, what’s worse is that the scam could have been easily spotted by Amazon. The mining script was an unencrypted plain text file, so all AWS needed to do was scan for certain well-known lines in its code that are used by other similar hacks — Platt gave the example of “xmrig” — to get suspicious and suspend the script. Apparently, that never happened. In the end, it took Amazon 27 hours to reply to Platt’s complaint. Considering the incredible increase in Platt’s monthly AWS spend (150,000%, he estimates), that’s a long time to wait for help. And despite the lengthy wait time, Platt says there’s still no solution — AWS is monitoring his account for 24 hours, after which, the case will be sent to the billing department for review, which he believes can take several days. A quick fix, it ain’t. Amazon finally called after 27 hrs, no doubt thanks to the attention this got. The agent was kind, but AWS\u0026#39; processes means I must wait another 24hrs of \u0026#39;monitoring\u0026#39; before the case is sent to billing \u0026#39;for review\u0026#39;, which can take days Knowing I\u0026#39;m not alone really helps, thanks \u0026mdash; Jonny Platt (@jonnyplatt)  If you’re an AWS customer, this whole saga should serve as a reminder to check your settings and ensure your account is secure. And it doesn’t hurt to keep an eye on your bank balance for any suspicious outgoings. As cryptocurrencies continue to grow — and GPU makers release more  — this kind of scam could become all too common.",

The news comes just a week after Ubisoft announced its own NFT integration, called , which will bring NFTs into . ‘s blockchain integration is , though it raises more questions as well. The new features are part of a program called , which is hosted on NFT platform . GSC Game World CEO Evgeniy Grygorovych, the game’s publisher, describes the project as the “first AAA game with a unique meta experience.” A press release notes that the feature will “use blockchain technology to let the community own a piece of .” S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  will begin auctioning off NFT drops in January, and users can start registering sometime this month. Another “secretive” drop will happen in February. It’s not exactly clear what players will be buying. A press release mentions that they can get unique items that won’t effect gameplay or give players an advantage. They can be traded even before the game launches in April. DMarket notes that the items will be able to travel across chains and platforms. It notes that they’ll be usable in at least one other game from GSC Game World. The marketplace says it’s working with other publishers to make purchased items usable in more games. The more unique aspect of this is that drops will give players a chance to become NPCs in the game. Those who buy a “metahuman” spot will have their likeness scanned into the game via photogrammetry. That NPC will appear in the game for all players. For now, only one metahuman spot will be available as part of the January drop. Spaces will be limited and players will be able to trade their right to become a metahuman before the game launches. As for pricing, DMarket is tight-lipped for now.

This payment feature is powered by the Meta-owned , which uses Pax Dollars (USDP) to facilitate transfers, and they all go through instantly. Meta launched Novi back in 2020, , “With Novi, sending money will be as easy as sending a message. You’ll be able to use Novi as a stand-alone app, as well as in Messenger and WhatsApp. There will be no hidden charges to add, send, receive or withdraw money, and your transfers will arrive instantly. All Novi customers will be verified using government-issued ID, and fraud protections will be built in throughout the app.” New in the US: use your  digital wallet to send and receive money right within a  chat.

Accessing Novi in WhatsApp, if you’re one of those who have access, works like sending any old attachment. Just tap the  button, select , enter the amount, and send it. As for the USPD currency being used, it’s a stablecoin — a cryptocurrency that’s doesn’t fluctuate much and is backed by the regular U.S. dollar to prevent fluctuation and fraud. This means you can expect 1 USPD to equal 1 USD, so what you send and what you can expect to be received should always be in sync. The Pax Dollar is being used as part of a partnership with Paxos and Coinbase by Meta, even though the company already had its own Diem cryptocurrency. In October, the head of Novi, David Marcus, said the company was simply waiting for regulatory approval, and this is likely the current status quo.

    "title": "What Is the Metaverse? The Future of the Internet Explained | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Long before  and CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about “the metaverse” at great length, the concept of the metaverse was already thriving and rapidly expanding. There’s no escaping the truth — the metaverse is here, and it’s probably here to stay. The question is, what is the metaverse? Is it as big a deal as some companies make it out to be, or is it just a passing trend that will be forgotten in a few months? Do you need to know all about the metaverse, and should you get involved before it blows up further? In this article, we take a deep dive into the concept of the metaverse and talk about its past, present, and most importantly, its future. The metaverse is indeed a virtual reality, but it’s not quite the same thing as what you’ve seen in science fiction blockbusters. Imagine a franchise like , where the world is a digital simulation that everyone is connected to, and is so well-made that nearly no one knows that it’s not real. The metaverse is not quite like that, but it definitely has the potential to evolve into something fantastically immersive. The idea behind the metaverse has been around for much longer than Meta’s vision of it — in fact, it’s far older than even Facebook itself. Zuckerberg referred to it as “an embodied internet that you’re inside of instead of just looking at.” The real meaning of the metaverse is just as broad as Zuckerberg’s vague description of it. At its most basic, the metaverse is a virtual reality that allows people from all over the world to interact, both with each other and with the metaverse itself. Users are often allowed to obtain items that remain theirs between sessions, or even land within the metaverse. However, there are many ways to interpret that concept, and it has evolved greatly over the years. On the internet, we’re always interacting with something — be it a website, a game, or a chat program that connects us to our friends. The metaverse takes this one step further and puts the user in the middle of the action. This opens the door to stronger, more realistic experiences that simply browsing the web or watching a video fail to evoke very often, if ever. Virtual reality (VR) and  (AR) are both concepts that are closely tied to the metaverse, but they are not one and the same. Instead of viewing them as different iterations of what is essentially the same thing, it’s good to view them as separate entities that supplement each other. VR and AR equipment allows the user to immerse themselves in a virtual world. In the case of VR, we are shown completely different surroundings. Be it a game or a movie, VR lets you interact with the changing world around you. AR, on the other hand, adds elements to your real surroundings and lets you interact with them in various ways. The difference lies in the purpose. You can play a VR or AR game at any given time without interacting with others, but the foundation of the metaverse, as envisioned by Meta and other companies, is human contact. In short, the metaverse is the playground for both of the above — a way for people to share a virtual universe together, be it for work, school, exercise, or simply for fun. The use of VR and AR tools will go a long way in expanding the metaverse and making it feel like a real experience as opposed to a video game with extra steps. However, the concept of the metaverse goes far beyond just VR and AR — it’s meant to bring people closer together in previously unheard of ways. This, in turn, also opens a lot of room for expansion. Zuckerberg’s recent Meta keynote turned millions of new pairs of eyes toward the metaverse, but there are several giants in this race to the future. Each of these companies has its own vision of the metaverse, which only serves to further expand the already vast meaning of the word. Facebook’s journey toward the metaverse is actually not that surprising. In March 2014, Facebook acquired Oculus for $2.3 billion. The company continued releasing Oculus Quest products, making some of the  currently out there. Considering that Meta now plans to heavily rely on both VR and AR in order to bring realism to the metaverse, buying Oculus seven years ago doesn’t feel like a random decision at all. It’s worth noting that Oculus Quest will soon be no more. Starting in 2022, the entire product line will be rebranded to Meta Quest, thus finally completing the acquisition and erasing the previous branding. In addition to Meta Quest, Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta, announced that some Oculus products will be called Meta Horizon. According to Bosworth, this will be the branding that encompasses the entirety of the VR metaverse platform. With Facebook’s huge announcement out in the open, . The tech giant is looking to build a metaverse of sorts inside Microsoft Teams starting as early as 2022. Microsoft’s plan is to utilize Mesh in order to let every Teams user participate in video meetings, replacing webcam images with animated avatars. Artificial intelligence will be used to listen to the user’s voice and animate their avatar accordingly, complete with matching lip movements. Switching to 3D meetings will also produce additional hand movements. While Microsoft’s announcement may seem small when compared to Meta’s, it’s definitely a step into the metaverse that clearly illustrates the company’s interest. These changes to Teams indicates that, much like Meta, Microsoft might want to integrate the metaverse into the future of remote work. Nvidia also has a horse in the metaverse race, and it’s called the Nvidia Omniverse. The company calls it “a platform for connecting 3D worlds into a shared virtual universe”. Nvidia’s Omniverse is cloud-native, meaning that it’s a shared, persistent platform that remains the same between sessions. It runs on RTX-based systems and can be streamed remotely to any device. The graphics card giant seems to have, so far, gone down a slightly different route with its metaverse. Meta and Microsoft place a lot of emphasis on the social aspect of the metaverse, but Nvidia’s focus is collaboration and exploring new technologies. The Omniverse is used by designers, robotics engineers, and other experts to simulate the real world in virtual reality. One example is Ericsson — its engineers use Omniverse to simulate 5G waves in urban environments. Looking into the future, we’ve got another big-ticket player on the horizon. Apple is rumored to be working on both a full VR headset and AR glasses, and all signs point toward the brand reaching for the metaverse. Both of these devices would likely have to plug into a metaverse in order to function, so Apple may not be that far behind Meta when it comes to building the metaverse. Short answer: Not really. Long answer: Maybe a little bit, depending on your point of view. Online games such as , , or  are all metaverses — each in their own way. They create a lasting world for their players to join and leave as they please. A player’s progress is saved on an external server and shared with other users, meaning that everything you do in these games can be revisited at a later time. Technically, every game could be considered a metaverse, and the metaverses that various tech giants are working on can all include some aspects of gaming. However, the idea of the metaverse is much broader than just that of a video game. The metaverse is meant to replace, or improve, real-life functionality in a virtual space. Things that users do in their day-to-day life, such as attending classes or going to work, can all be done in the metaverse instead. There are some similarities between video game metaverses and the idea of a broader metaverse. You can interact with others, perform various tasks together, and to some extent, shape the world around you. However, all of this is firmly set within the limitations of the game. A good example of this is that you can build yourself a giant castle in , but in , you don’t have that same freedom. Players are allowed to own a garrison, which is a plot of land of sorts, but they have little to no influence on what it looks like and where it’s placed. More importantly, the plot is the same for all players and they can only visit each other when invited. Although the titles mentioned above are what’s popular right now, it’s worth noting that the concept of the metaverse exists in many video games, and it has been around for a long time. , a game from 2003 that’s still around to this day, is essentially a metaverse that doesn’t have an end goal the way many other games do: It just lets you roam the world and interact with other players. Oh, and you can also fly. In an ideal metaverse, you forge your own destiny, and many of the common video game limitations are removed. However, the first step is the same for nearly every metaverse, game-related or not: You have to create your character. In the metaverse, users are given an avatar — a representation of themselves that they can tweak to look however they like. The way the avatar looks depends on the platform. It can be something very basic, but it can also be high quality, with a lot of room for customization. Users can strive to remain true to life, but they can also turn themselves into someone entirely different. The avatar, once created, is the user’s ticket to the metaverse — a virtual universe where the sky is the limit, provided one has the imagination to suspend reality for a little while. The avatar can move, speak, explore the area, and more. The limitations of the avatar lie entirely with the platform. Some instances of the metaverse resemble a video game and let the user walk around using a keyboard and mouse. More advanced versions involve the use of virtual reality headsets and controls that truly immerse the user in the world by replicating their real-life movements in the metaverse. Different companies have different takes on the avatar-creating process. Microsoft Mesh is being integrated into Teams in 2022, bringing something new to the metaverse table. The program will allow the user to create a fully customized avatar of themselves. Through the use of mixed reality technology, the avatar will represent the user in a realistic way. In the future, this will involve a full range of facial expressions, body language, and backgrounds. Meta has big plans when it comes to avatar creation in its upcoming metaverse, Horizon Worlds. The avatars will be supported by VR and will replicate the user’s actions in real time. While this all sounds peachy, these avatars do not currently have legs — possibly to make the movement and travel easier to manage. However, Meta is also working on photorealistic Codec Avatars: Impressive-looking, ultrarealistic avatars that will be rendered in rea time along with the surrounding environment. Regardless of the platform, the ideal metaverse will let the user pick what they want to look like while retaining the realism of facial expressions and movements when supported by VR. Before answering this question, we need to distinguish “the metaverse” from “a metaverse.” There is no one singular metaverse that connects all the other universes into one cohesive whole, although they all involve the use of the internet to connect their users to one another. As such, every metaverse can look entirely different from the rest. The way a metaverse looks depends entirely on its creator. Some metaverses are sandbox-like, giving a lot of room for creation and not limiting the user a whole lot in terms of what they end up building. Think , but bigger: Everyone shares the same world instead of  with friends. A metaverse can look like a classroom, a street, a fantasy forest, or the bottom of the ocean. In such a metaverse, real-world rules still mostly apply. You’re likely to see the sky, buildings, and nature, and most significantly, other people. The art style depends on the metaverse and can be cartoony, realistic, or anything in between. However, as Zuckerberg emphasized during his Meta keynote, the metaverse doesn’t suffer from the same limitations as the real world does. There is no reason why you couldn’t go to space with your entire family in the metaverse, provided its creators allowed for this to happen. The bottom line is that a metaverse can look like a classroom, a street, a fantasy forest, or the bottom of the ocean. However, the most popular instances of it offer something that’s a mix of all of those things, all thanks to the freedom they provide their users. Let’s take a moment to quickly recap where we stand. We’ve got a virtual reality where the only limitations lie in the hands of its creator. We’ve got an avatar that represents us. Of course, we have an internet connection that lets us join this shared world. Where do we go from here? It depends. In an ideal world, the metaverse should connect each and every user to one another. Joining a public server should provide the ability to interact with everyone else who is connected at the time. The reality is often different. As certain metaverses grow more popular, it becomes impossible for the servers that host them to handle such huge traffic loads. This means that some developers create different layers that separate the users, effectively making the world a little smaller. There may come a time in the future when this can be avoided, but right now, the metaverse is often fragmented — not to mention the fact that people use different platforms, effectively choosing their preferred universe. As mentioned above, every company has a different take on the metaverse. Facebook is working on Horizon Worlds, Nvidia has its Omniverse, and much smaller fish in this very big pond are also joining in. The cryptocurrency world has metaverses of its own. The fact that these metaverses are disconnected from each other, operate on different platforms, and have no shared uses or goal, means that the idea of one large metaverse is currently impossible. If the metaverse is meant to be one giant, shared virtual world, all the companies involved in releasing their own metaverses would have to join forces. For that to happen, not only would these brands have to cooperate, but server technology would have to rapidly advance. In order to host all of these different iterations of the metaverse on one platform, unimaginable server loads would have to be handled not just by the host, but also the end user. Until this is possible, the metaverse may always be somewhat fragmented, forcing the users to choose their universe of choice before they connect to the shared world. The metaverse, as a concept, is not very easy to define, if only because of how limitless it seems to be. This means that its general purpose can be defined on a case-by-case basis — not just the company or group of people that create it, but also each individual user. The general purpose of the metaverse is to connect with others through a virtual, shared universe. Be it for work, self-improvement, or simply entertainment, the metaverse exists to breach the borders of reality and distance, connecting people from all over the globe. Allowing users, portrayed by their avatars, to interact with the world at large without giving them any clear goals allows for a lot of freedom of choice. This is also what Meta has built its big reveal on — the fact that in the metaverse, you can essentially do just about anything you want. Let’s take a look at some of the more common things you can do in the metaverse. A common theme in metaverses involves allowing users to buy plots of land. Such a property, upon purchase, becomes assigned to one particular user and is unavailable to other players as long as it’s owned by that specific avatar. Plots can be bought or rented, just like in the real world. Owning property often allows the user to utilize it in whichever way they might want. Some choose to build a gallery to house the items they own, while others create shops or shared public spaces. The concept of letting the users roam free and build whatever they want in their own space is not new, and it definitely plays into the success of games such as  or . User creativity saves a lot of time for the developers of the metaverse, who would otherwise have to spend it on designing the buildings themselves. Of course, this is the internet, and too much freedom can lead to various forms of abuse. Most metaverses continue to supervise the content created by their users, and depending on the host, it may be taken down. Even a seemingly infinite universe has its limitations. Once you own something in the metaverse, it can be sold or traded to one of the other users. This adds an element of wealth and prestige to an otherwise detached world. Some lots are worth more than others, some items are rare while others are common — all of this adds up to the creation of an economy that applies to a particular metaverse. Typically, plots of land in the metaverse vary in size and location. As this is a virtual rendition of real life, it’s not a surprise that the real estate market is alive and well even in the metaverse. Contested plots, located closer to busy areas or simply made more desirable through some other luxury, can reach much higher prices than a tiny square of grass on the outskirts of town. Some metaverses attract not just regular users, but also companies. As the universe is shared by many, this opens up the opportunity to advertise. Simply buying land and displaying the logo of the company can be an effective way to pique or refresh interest. Companies are able to benefit from the metaverse in more ways than one. Organizing events, creating crossovers between franchises, and engaging with the user base is made easier in a seemingly limitless universe. The above examples of what you can do in the metaverse are all technicalities when you compare them to the ideal metaverse — a place almost capable of replacing reality. We’re not quite there yet (and we won’t be for years), but the efforts of companies like Meta or  are bringing us closer to this than we’ve ever been before. In a perfect metaverse, you are capable of interacting with every person around you. This goes beyond the text-based chat we’ve all seen in games such as  or . Incorporating voice communication, , and AR glasses allows for interaction on a whole new level. Whether it’s meeting your friends and going skydiving or forming a study group in a virtual library, the main concept of the metaverse will always revolve around human interaction — just not in person. From Meta to Microsoft, many companies place a lot of emphasis on the ability to work, cooperate, and study together in the metaverse. Microsoft is planning to use Mesh to bring realism to otherwise dull video meetings. Meta hopes to create virtual workspaces, giving remote workers a chance to spend time together in virtual reality during their workday. The metaverse can also be used for work in different ways, including simulating real-world tasks in virtual reality first. This can be utilized by engineers, programmers, designers, and many other professionals through metaverses such as Nvidia’s Omniverse. When speaking of the metaverse, it’s impossible not to mention cryptocurrencies. After all, some of the biggest instances of it are based on the blockchain — the decentralized framework that cryptocurrencies operate within. One such example is Decentraland, a sandbox-like metaverse that lets its users buy plots of land, explore other plots, and interact with each other. The entire economy is based around MANA — a cryptocurrency used specifically in Decentraland. What sets these metaverses apart from commercially owned universes is the fact that they rely on a decentralized network where your assets are your own and are not controlled by the owner(s) of the metaverse. Cryptocurrencies, and therefore also the universes that are set around them, are usually decentralized. This means that the currency, virtual land, or the whole metaverse is not owned by a single entity and cannot be taken down, sold, or otherwise destroyed on a whim. Decentralization involves contracts distributed to a network of users and a majority vote. Unless the majority of the network votes to take the metaverse down, it should, in theory, remain accessible to everyone. This is not the case in gaming metaverses, such as , where your account continues to belong to the company in charge of the game. This means that all of your assets, such as your equipment or your characters, are ultimately not yours to control. This is where  come in. NFTs can be anything from (frankly, rather ugly) 8-pixel avatars to breathtaking works of art. At their core, NFTs are a decentralized way to assign ownership to virtual goods. Anyone can download a photo and claim it as their own, but NFTs involve cryptocurrency and contracts that pin down ownership to one particular user. In the metaverse, this opens up a whole new level of economy that turns this fantastical concept into a way for people to make (or lose) real-world money. Users can buy virtual plots of land, avatars, or even a hat for their metaverse avatar — all through the use of cryptocurrency. Non-fungible tokens are independent of the metaverse, but they do play a part in the economy of certain universes, such as Decentraland or The Sandbox — an upcoming metaverse that is not yet live. The Sandbox sells plots of land in the form of NFTs, assigning full ownership to the person who buys them. The users can then visit that plot and interact with its contents. Just one glance at The Sandbox’s map shows that this form of NFTs caught the interest of not just cryptocurrency fanatics, but also dozens of companies that see it as a new advertising space to explore. Some big-name brands and franchises already own land in The Sandbox ahead of its launch. You’ll see gigantic plots of land belonging to Atari, RollerCoaster Tycoon, The Walking Dead, Shaun the Sheep, and even South China Morning Post. This is a mix of brands that no one would ever accuse of having much of an interest in either NFTs or the metaverse, but the concept shows promise, and some companies are looking to capitalize on that. It’s difficult not to draw similarities between the real-world economy and the way the cryptocurrency market ties into some of the most popular metaverses. The end result can be wonderful or jarring, depending on which side of the fence you’re on. No one can deny that the concept of the metaverse has started to spread to previously uncharted lands. We’ve gone a long way from its humble beginnings in games such as , or even the long-gone, long-forgotten . According to Zuckerberg, Meta hopes to hit the ground running with Horizon Worlds, although even Zuckerberg admits that we’re not quite there yet. It will take years for the metaverse to permeate our reality to the point of being as widely known and accessible as what Meta is hoping to achieve. The vision of the metaverse as a shared universe where people separated by continents can play, learn, share, and even work together is futuristic and idyllic in equal measure. Bustling streets filled with stores, parks, and people can all be recreated in the metaverse, but the technology needed to support it is still not something that every person can easily access. Another step toward mainstream recognition lies in the realism of the metaverse experience. The introduction of VR and AR into the metaverse will certainly go a long way in making the experience feel far more realistic than it does with a keyboard and mouse. We’ve already seen interesting crossovers that tested the limits of the metaverse. Travis Scott performed a virtual concert in  that was attended by over 12 million people. Justin Bieber has just announced that he plans to do the same. Even though The Sandbox isn’t live yet, Snoop Dogg, an avid supporter of NFTs, already owns land in it and lets people buy VIP passes to visit his mansion in the future. Zuckerberg believes that the future of the internet lies in the metaverse — he even went as far as to call it the successor to mobile internet. Whether that is true still remains to be seen. One thing is for sure — it’s difficult to deny that the metaverse is no longer a wild concept pulled straight out of a sci-fi film. Facebook/Meta has just added fuel to a fire that has already been burning, and in a few years, we may be seeing the metaverse utilized in ways we previously haven’t even thought possible.",

    "detailContent": " When Nvidia introduced its Lite Hash Rate (LHR) GPU cores, it seemed like an answer to cryptocurrency miners. Like the limiter featured on early  models, though, miners have found another way to bypass the LHR cores — and this time, they can take full advantage of the GPU’s power. To combat the demand from miners, Nvidia added  to its new graphics cards. That included all cards except the RTX 3090. This was meant to make them much less attractive to Ethereum (ETH) miners, as the LHR core limited the ETH hash rate, but it seems that the miners come out on top.  was the first to bypass the limiter by restoring up to 70% mining performance to Nvidia’s RTX 30-Series cards. While this brought back a large portion of the card’s mining power, it still left 30% unused. However, mining enthusiasts found another workaround. Cue  — a program that allows its users to dedicate the remaining 30% of GPU power towards mining a second cryptocurrency. While T-rex lets users mine two currencies at once, only 30% of  power can be dedicated to mining ETH. The remaining 70% can be put towards mining something less profitable instead. This is an interesting choice that might make the software less profitable to those who strongly prefer maximizing the much more expensive Ethereum mining potential. Anyone who has tried to build a PC in the last year or so knows full well that the  right now. The best graphics cards are amongst the most difficult components to find. Nvidia RTX 30-series GPUs are excellent for mining. Add to that the fact that there aren’t many cards in stock to begin with, let alone at their recommended prices, and also the fact that most are snapped up by scalpers — we’re left with a bare market and many frustrated PC builders. It’s worth noting that not all of Nvidia’s  will be able to mine two cryptocurrencies at once. Different coins have different video memory (VRAM) requirements, which means that certain pairings will not be made available to the owners of Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti cards. On the other hand, RTX 3080 Ti owners should be able to pair most currencies, as these cards have at least 12GB of VRAM. Although Nvidia has tried to make sure that its newest GPUs will only be bought by regular users, it seems that this was a largely failed attempt. Cryptocurrency miners continue buying and using Ampere cards in droves. That means bad news for the (already struggling) graphics card market, as we may not see an  until late 2022.",

    "title": "What Is GPU Mining, and Why It’s Better Than Your CPU | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " At the onset of , CPUs were the primary way to conduct mining operations. Today, unless you’re using application-specific integrated circuits (, the next best thing is GPU mining, and for many cryptocurrencies, it’s the dominant form of mining. Here’s a breakdown of what GPU mining is and how it has started to cause real problems for the hardware industries it draws from. Mining is essentially running software to solve complex mathematical problems in order to verify transactions on a cryptographic blockchain. Once a miner completes the math problem, the reward is a portion of cryptocurrency that’s associated what the mining activity. These verified transactions are the backbone of how a decentralized cryptocurrency is able to function as a legitimate currency. Cryptocurrency miners use their equipment to calculate a specific number called a “nonce,” or “number only used once.” This nonce is plugged into a hash function (such as SHA-256) and calculated. Since the miner doesn’t know what the exact nonce is, multiple calculations have to be done in parallel to get the right number quickly. This is where GPUs come into play. GPUs are specifically designed to render 3D graphics and shapes. This requires complex mathematical calculations that need to be done in parallel. For example, if you’re playing , your computer or console’s GPU has to not only render the entire game world (including shading, lighting, and shadows), but also the character models, guns, bullets, and game physics all at the same time. This requires the ability to compute massive amounts of calculations all at once, and it’s something  are very good at. The same applies to GPU mining, where the many thousands of parallel processing cores in modern GPUs make them great at brute forcing the complex math problems needed to calculate mining hashes and ultimately earn their miners some cryptocurrency. While you can technically still  with GPUs,  (ASIC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) can be purpose-built for calculating specific hash algorithms and are far more efficient and capable than GPUs at . The number of GPUs it would take to match the “hashing rate” of a single ASIC would prove cost prohibitive due to the tremendous power requirements and costs involved. An  has a hashing rate of 150 million hashes per second (150MHps) and costs anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000. A popular ASIC like the Bitmain Antminer T17+originally cost a little over $800 and has a hashing rate of 64 trillion hashes per second (THps). It does consume a lot more power than an RTX 3090, around 10 times as much, but with its much greater hashing rate, it is a far superior piece of hardware for . That said, other cryptocurrencies can still provide a valuable profit for GPU miners, including Monero, Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin. A good way to determine what cryptocurrency to mine is to use a . This typically allows you to input the type of cryptocurrency you want to mine, the mining hardware you’re using or the hashing rate, and the amount of power you’re using. From there, you’re able to see how much you’ll be able to make. One of the more popular ways to mine solo is through software like . This allows you to rent your mining hardware out for others to mine for alt-currencies. You’re sent the profits in the form of Bitcoin. The process of setting up NiceHash on your computer is pretty simple and is perfect for those who don’t want to mess with using a command line. That said, it may be worth looking to either join a mining pool or utilizing cloud mining. A mining pool combines the hardware capabilities of multiple miners to increase their computational power. Cloud mining may be a decent option for those who don’t have the money to invest in their own hardware (especially these days). With cloud mining, you rent mining hardware from companies like  to do the heavy lifting for you. You are then paid for your investment with Bitcoin. There was a massive crypto boom starting around December 2020, when the price of Bitcoin and Ehereum jumped dramatically. This led crypto miners to quickly snap up ,  of all GPU sales. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the  and led Nvidia to  of newer 30-series cards. Despite the massive drawbacks to  and Litecoin on , the upside is that  can still be sold in the aftermarket because of their general-purpose use. ASICs by definition cannot be used outside of their intended purpose and thus lose a lot of value if the specific algorithm it’s programmed for isn’t in use. Additionally, if , that reduces the profitability of mining, which also reduces the demand for  and a big sell-off of mining GPUs that have lost profitability, which can lead to a glut of GPUs on the second-hand market, crashing prices there in turn.",

    "title": "The Internet\u0027s Phonebook Desperately Needs an Upgrade | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The websites we visit are scattered across a vast, messy web of underground cables, racks of metallic boxes, and a myriad of routers that we’ve come to call the internet. So when you punch in an address and hit enter, how does your browser know where to look? The answer is a system that’s been around since the days that the internet was so small and so compact, it could all be mapped in a single text file. It’s called the  (or DNS for short), and although it has kept up with the internet’s evolving role for decades, it has also crumbled more frequently than ever in recent years — and taken down some of the web’s biggest sites along with it. That increasing frequency has led many to call for a better system — but replacing the very foundations of the worldwide web is no easy undertaking. The DNS is one of the internet’s most vital cogs. It acts as the internet’s phonebook. Not the thick, physical kind but more akin to the digital one on your phone. The DNS’s job is to translate a website name into its computer-friendly address. You see, electronic devices like your computer or your modem router don’t understand the language we speak. They talk in numbers. So when you type in a domain name like “digitaltrends.com,” the browser doesn’t quite know what it means. It needs that website’s unique identification number — its physical address (192.0.66.16 for Digital Trends) to navigate through the maze of servers and routers, then trace the website’s location and bring it up on your screen. In other words, the DNS’s job is to translate a website name into its computer-friendly address — similar to how your phone’s contacts app lets you access a mobile number or an address by simply entering a person’s name. Except unlike your phone’s contacts app, the internet’s phonebook has nearly 2 billion entries of websites (and counting). So every time you enter a URL in the address bar, your browser first calls the DNS and requests it to fetch the website’s number. Once the DNS returns that information, the browser can find and connect to the website’s server. This all happens in the blink of an eye, and browsers are able to cut back further on how long the DNS process takes by caching the IDs of the websites you visit often. Without the DNS, your browser would be lost in the dark without a flashlight. It’s essential for pretty much anything that involves a web address, which covers most of your internet activities, from sending someone a text to processing a digital payment. In the span of a single a day, hundreds of billions of DNS pings are exchanged — a trillion in the case of Comcast. The DNS has been around since the 1970s, when the internet was restricted to the walls of a few universities. Unlike today’s global, decentralized system, it was just a text file with a list of all the connected computers’ numerical addresses — and it was maintained by a single woman named Elizabeth Feinler. But DNS has unquestionably evolved far beyond what its original makers envisioned. And as a result of this forced evolution, cracks have begun to appear in its architecture. The bigger concern is the consolidation in the DNS market. In July 2021, several banking pages and services like Airbnb, Amazon, and others went offline for over an hour due to a DNS bug. A similar issue disrupted a large chunk of the internet in 2020. In fact, such outages are so common that the phrase “it’s always DNS,” which pokes fun at how the DNS is usually responsible for a network snag, has become a popular joke among technologists. The reason DNS is involved with so many internet outages, according to Dan York, the director of online content at the Internet Society, is simply because “it operates at a huge scale beyond that of any other service.” There are dozens of moving parts, and since it all works like some high-speed relay race, even when one of them malfunctions, it breaks the entire DNS chain. In the grand scheme of things, though, DNS’s error rate is fairly low (remember: trillions of queries pass through it every day). According to data supplied by Pingdom, a global network-monitoring platform, DNS has been only responsible for 4% of daily outages this year so far. The bigger concern is the consolidation in the DNS market. One of the original objectives behind moving on from the original text file to the modern DNS was to engineer a “distributed database” that “avoids the problems caused by a centralized database.” But what has happened is that as more people came online and network demands grew, large companies delegated their DNS duties to third-party hosting services like Cloudflare and Amazon Web Services. Most of the top thousand domains have coalesced around just four infrastructure providers. So any time there’s a bug in one of these providers, a massive chunk of the mainstream web goes offline. ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit regulatory body that oversees DNS standards, has no control over which hosting services companies pick. Because of this, Raj Jain, a computer science professor at Washington University, believes there’s a dire need for a law against all internet monopolies, including DNS providers and search engines. A few startups have more ambitious solutions in mind, however. , a blockchain-powered platform, argues the centralization of the DNS into the hands of a couple of hosting companies and “gatekeepers” like ICANN has made it vulnerable to cyberattacks and censorship. It wants to decentralize the Domain Name System for good by distributing its root onto a blockchain network, where everyone can “truly” own their domains instead of trusting a third party. “Handshake lets us create a whole new phone book,” Handshake domain registrar, Namebase’s head of marketing, Jake Schaeffer, told Digital Trends, “owned by no one and everyone at the same time.” In reality, though, it’s close to impossible to replicate DNS’ ability to scale. Previous attempts similar to Handshake’s have come and failed. DNS processes hundreds of thousands of queries per second, and any new technologies such as blockchain can’t keep up with this rapid rate of change, says Eric Osterweil, an assistant computer science professor at George Mason University and former vice-chair of the team responsible for analyzing the DNS’ security, stability, and reliability. “My view is that the collision-free namespace of DNS is something we would likely never be able to create again,” added Osterweil. An ICANN spokesperson said the coalition doesn’t believe “there are significant issues with DNS administration or scaling,” and that it “closely follows the development of new identifier technologies, such as those based on blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.” A blockchain-based alternative to the DNS doesn’t have any takers yet. But it’s a familiar story — and one we’ve seen before in the case of Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin has been in development for over a decade, and it’s still far from replacing traditional currencies. Its partial success paints a promising picture, though. Whether companies like Handshake can replicate this success to build a reliable DNS alternative remains to be seen. ICANN, in its strategic plan for the next few years, has identified many of the DNS’ common issues and allocated more budget to pare down its risks. But if history is any indication, even once updates to resolve these issues are executed, they’ll take years to roll out. Until then, DNS will keep knocking the internet’s most visited destinations offline once in a while, and the “it’s always DNS” chants will continue.",

    "detailContent": " Amid the , AMD’s response to if it would take any action against cryptocurrency miners was a resounding “no.” Now, it seems Team Red might be taking some notes from Nvidia. A new, unbranded card has leaked that features two Radeon RX 570 cores, and it could be AMD’s response to crypto miners. Twitter user @9550pro, who has previously leaked information about Intel’s , shared photos of the card that were posted to the Saraba1st forum. The card reportedly combines two of AMD’s 14nm RX 570 cores to double the mining performance, creating the tentatively named Radeon RX 570 Duo. Sapphire ETH mining RX 570 Duo🤪 125W 60MH/s Source:   \u0026mdash; HXL (@9550pro)  Based on the GPU-Z screenshot the original poster provided (below), the pictured card comes from Sapphire and PC Partner. Sapphire is a long-standing add-in board partner (AIB) for AMD graphics cards, and PC Partner is a  maker based out of Hong Kong. It’s not clear if the RX 570 Duo is a new card AMD is working on or a mad experiment dreamt up by two GPU makers. It seems unlikely that AMD is working on an entirely new card. The 14nm Polaris architecture is five years old, and the RX 570 itself is over four years old. Even with two cores smashed together, the RX 570 Duo  as an Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti or AMD RX 6800 for mining Ethereum. However, it’s possible that AMD is revitalizing the older architecture. In May, AMD  with U.S.-based chipmaker GlobalFoundries through 2024, who was behind the manufacturing of Polaris. AMD has already turned to Taiwan-based chipmaker TSMC for its  and processors that are built on a smaller node, so AMD could be riding out its commitment with older architecture. A possible RX 570 Duo could draw miners away from AMD’s newer cards that are targeting gamers. Measured in millions of hashes per second (MH/s), the RX 570 8GB is capable of about 30.9 MH/s when mining Ethereum. The original poster shared an image showing similar mining performance across both of the RX 570 Duo’s cores, combing for a hash rate of around 60 MH/s. The recently released  is reportedly capable of half of that — around 28 MH/s. In response to the growing demand from cryptocurrency miners, Nvidia introduced its . These cards are built specifically for mining, and Nvidia pointed miners toward them to take the strain off of its consumer cards. AMD hasn’t fired back yet, but that could be what the RX 570 Duo is. This likely isn’t the final design, though. The shared images show a rather cheap-looking cooler haphazardly stuck on a board and a single HDMI output. Nvidia’s CMP cards don’t feature any video outputs. If AMD is working on a mining card, we hope it comes soon — especially as the  continues to rise.",

    "detailContent": " A surge of graphics cards on secondhand marketplaces has brought down GPU prices a lot, but when shopping on sites like eBay, Mercari, and Facebook Marketplace, you’re playing Russian Roulette. Palit Microsystems, a Taiwan-based graphics card maker, says that graphics cards that have been run in crypto farms can drop as much as 10% of performance per year. In speaking with , Palit said that independent tests have shown up to a 10% drop in performance after a year of a card running in a mining operation. Outside of the performance drop, mining cards are often subjected to intense heat and power draw, as they’re sandwiched between other cards operating at full speed. A recent influx of graphics cards on secondhand marketplaces is the center of the conversation. After China imposed restrictions on cryptocurrency mining, marketplaces saw . They’re a tempting proposition, especially after nearly a year of inflated GPU prices. It’s important to be careful shopping for a , especially if you get it pre-owned. The drop in performance is one thing, but cards running at full speed 24/7 may carry other issues, as well. Prolonged exposure to high heat can damage the components inside the card and limit the cooling potential, leading to decreased performance and lifespan. This is becoming increasingly important in the U.S. with falling Ethereum prices. Peaking a few months ago, the price of Ethereum has started to level off, and the switch to a new validation model will make traditional GPU mining obsolete later this year. The U.S. houses , so a rush of secondhand mining cards is likely. The  has pushed the prices of graphics cards to obscene limits, as well as limited supply at traditional retailers. With more cards popping up on sites like eBay, going secondhand can be tempting. Before you do that, though, you should know the risks that come along with it. There are ways to  new in 2021, so we recommend sticking with them. If you need to shop secondhand, it’s important to do as many social checks as possible. That usually comprises looking at seller ratings, other listings, and feedback. If the seller has a lot of cards available — particularly of the same model — that might indicate they were used for mining. In addition, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is and the card was likely used in a mining rig. A visual inspection helps, too, though that doesn’t always reveal much. Unfortunately, there’s no way to know for sure. It’s possible you can pick up a mining card that wasn’t driven into the ground, and it’s possible you can pick up a unit that works for a few months before unexpectedly dying. If you’re shopping in the secondhand market, you have to roll the dice.",

    "title": "India\u0027s Grand Plan to End Spam Failed, But Still Has Merit | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " For a few days in March 2021, millions of Indians suddenly couldn’t access many of the apps and services they relied on for everyday life. Every time they request a one-time passcode (OTP) to authenticate a bank transaction, retrieve a forgotten social media login, or register for a vaccine appointment, they ended up waiting forever for an SMS text that was never on its way. Why? As it turns out, the one-time passcodes required to run these services were blocked by India’s new blockchain-powered SMS “scrubbing” system designed to cut down on . Obviously, this wasn’t the intended result of the anti-spam system. The plan itself had noble intentions, but due to some anticompetitive lawsuits and bunches of bureaucracy, most companies held off on complying with the new telecommunication rules — which ultimately prevented their OTPs from reaching their users. To fix the issue, India’s telecom authority paused the rollout of the anti-spam blockchain network, thereby allowing OTP deliveries to resume and restoring access to everyone’s banks, social media accounts, and everything else. Looking back on the way things transpired, it’s hard to see India’s anti-spam plan as anything but a failure. But despite the fact that the rollout of this technology was so badly bungled, India’s blockchain-powered spam-blocking idea still holds big promise. In a lot of ways, it’s a glimpse into what blockchain technology could do beyond cryptocurrency — and it’s worth revisiting. Globally speaking, spam has consistently grown by double-digit figures for the last few years — with no end in sight. In the United States, mobile subscribers received a  in March 2021, up 37% from the month before. In 2020, losses from fraudulent SMS amounted to , according to the Federal Trade Commission. And in a country like India, which is home to 1.36 billion people (over 4 times the population of the U.S.), the problem is even worse. Giulia Porter, vice president of RoboKiller, a spam-blocking service, believes the reason worldwide spam issues have been prevalent is simply because of the complexity and diversity of the telecommunications industry — where there are no incentives or regulations to stop spam calls in a unified way. Porter adds that advancements in tech have been a double-edged sword since they’ve also allowed spammers to constantly adapt and come up with new methods to evade enforcement efforts. So, in the face of such a large and unruly problem, India decided to test out a powerful new tool: Blockchains. India’s blockchain framework, which is designed to curb “unsolicited commercial communication,” enables authorities to bring accountability and traceability into the country’s rampant spam industry. It requires marketers, bulk senders, and mobile carriers to register themselves on a digital ledger. This network also hosts users’ preferences over whether they’d like to receive unsolicited texts. So, only when a mass commercial SMS meets the system’s antifraud standards — and the person targeted has opted into receiving the message — is it allowed to be delivered. The rest is scrubbed. In a country where , it was high time India took action on it. No one expected it to turn to a blockchain-based technology. India has nearly a billion mobile subscribers and more than a billion commercial SMS messages are transmitted in the country every day. Relying on traditional channels to organize these heaps of sensitive data — which are being controlled by dozens of mobile carriers and marketers — would have meant hoarding it all in a central location, thereby making it less secure and more vulnerable to breaches (as has happened several times in the past in India). A distributed, blockchain-based approach seemed like a much better idea. With this kind of distributed architecture in mind, India built a system in which each telecom operator has the ability to establish a dedicated node in the country’s mobile network. Every operator’s clients, marketers, and individual mobile subscribers exist as a branch of that telecom’s node. All these sources’ inputs automatically flow through the network in real time and eliminate the need for any particular entity to maintain its separate database. In theory, India’s decision to adopt a blockchain is sound. After all, blockchain’s distributed nature is just the sort of technological backbone authorities need to tackle a problem as scattered and messy as spam. Since each call or text is verified for traces of fraud and cross-checked against a person’s choice, there’s little room for scammers to circumvent safeguards. India’s solution, unfortunately, didn’t go according to plan as the country mismanaged the implementation. So far, it’s been hit with a myriad of roadblocks, and the most significant of them has to do with the fact that local authorities concentrated the network’s control into the hands of a single company called Tanla. Complaints from other marketers and telecommunications companies argued that Tanla’s own business relies on mass SMS marketing campaigns, thereby raising a conflict of interest. The technology’s rollout has been dragged through the courts and has yet to prove its efficacy in the real world. Raja Jurdak, a professor of distributed systems at Australia’s Queensland University of Technology, told Digital Trends that while the idea is attractive on the surface, it involves “several issues, including trust, scalability, and privacy.” Since, instead of keeping the blockchain network public, India has opted for a private one, Jurdak says it raises privacy concerns over how the data of hundreds of millions of users is handled. Jurdak adds that the concentration of access and data at a single company goes against blockchain’s main design attribute, which is the decentralization of trust. Although India mishandled the execution, experts believe its blockchain approach could still work as a template for the rest of the world and theoretically save us from spam. Jurdak suggests increasing decentralization and providing suitable incentives to potential blockchain validators to participate in maintaining the blockchain — similar to a cryptocurrency — which would therefore reduce the need to trust individual participants. India isn’t alone, either. Blockchain has been quietly upending a range of legacy services across the globe and upgrading them for the new, virtual-first world. Some , for instance, are employing blockchain to track the temperature of multiple coronavirus vaccines before administering them to patients. Similarly, a  of telecom operators and vendors is building a distributed ledger to crack down on “wangiri” fraud calls. The “wangiri” concept involves malicious actors leaving an abrupt missed call from an international number to people. When someone calls back, these actors are able to rack up the hefty international connection fees. With blockchain, telecom companies are able to share intelligence on detected “wangiri” calls with each other in real time and incorporate the global data into their algorithms to proactively put an end to future such frauds. A central blockchain requires everyone to place the trust in a single organization that gets to “play god,” Brian Behlendorf, Linux Foundation’s general manager for Blockchain, Healthcare, and Identity, told Digital Trends “Distributed ledger technology allows all parties to place their trust in the system,” he says. “That changes everything.”",

Instead, they found about 100 computers mining cryptocurrency. The  that detectives received a tip prior to the raid. Onlookers said that they saw multiple people visiting the site throughout the day and police drones picked up a lot of heat coming from the building — typically a sign of a growing operation. Western Power Distribution also found that the site was illegally connected to its grid, stealing “thousands of pounds [worth of] of electricity.” “It had all the hallmarks of a cannabis cultivation setup,and I believe it is only the second such crypto mine we have encountered in the West Midlands,” Sgt. Jennifer Griffin said. The authorities seized the computers but didn’t make any arrests. Crypto-mining operations are becoming a problem not only in the U.K., but around the world.

    "detailContent": " Nvidia’s newly launched , which are designed for cryptocurrency mining, generated more than $155 million in revenue during the company’s fiscal first quarter. Sales of cryptocurrency mining cards are predicted to top $400 million for the current quarter. The company initially launched its CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processors) as a way to steer Ethereum miners from hoarding its limited supplies of gaming . While the CMPs aren’t designed for use in a computer, they can be used to mine for Ethereum currency. The company, like others in the semiconductor industry, has been experiencing supply issues of its gaming graphics cards, including the recently launched RTX 3000 series of GPUs. The CMPs were launched as part of Nvidia’s efforts to steer cryptocurrency miners away from its main lineup of , thereby preserving the limited inventory for gamers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed that the company’s core gaming business is the largest that he has seen, and Nvidia cannot risk upsetting gamers because crypto miners have been snatching up the company’s limited supply of GPUs, according to a report on . The CEO said that he hoped that the CMPs will fulfill the role to satisfy the needs of miners. It’s unclear how much money total Nvidia generated from cryptocurrency miners. In addition to the $155 million in CMP sales, miners have also purchased traditional GPUs that are traditionally designed for gaming, workstation use, and data centers. In one instance, a mining rig consisting of 78 RTX 3080 GPUs  in revenue for one miner. The company has since added other efforts to separate its crypto mining and gaming businesses, including adding a  to its GeForce RTX gaming cards to limit their appeal with miners. Nvidia has been under criticism from its gaming fans due to the limited availability of its latest graphics cards, which are based on the Ampere architecture, and supply constraints. Together, these factors make Nvidia’s GPUs hard to come by, and industry insiders expect that shortages will likely  Still, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress is reluctant to blame miners for the short supplies of GPUs, noting that it’s hard to determine to what extent that cryptocurrency has had an effect on demand, according to CNBC’s reporting. The worldwide pandemic likely contributed to supply constraints, making it difficult for Nvidia to manufacture the cards, and scalpers also have had an impact on GPU pricing. Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3000 series starts at $399, though prices can reach as high as $1,499 for the top-tier configuration. Impatient gamers unwilling to wait for Nvidia to replenish inventory of its cards have resorted to secondary markets, like eBay, where scalpers have asked for double or triple the card’s suggested retail price. Because of overwhelming demand for GPUs, Nvidia’s core business is still healthy. The company reported that revenue increased by 106% from the prior year. And despite shortages, Nvidia is believed to be launching new GPUs at Computex in June, and the rumored  could be unveiled at the Taiwan-based show.",

    "title": "Crypto Art Has a Climate Problem, and There\u0027s No Easy Fix | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " When the website ArtStation announced plans to start offering , short for non-fungible tokens, the last thing it expected was backlash. But within hours of tweeting about its intentions, that’s precisely what it got. Almost immediately, the site’s patrons loudly voiced their opposition to the move, citing concerns about the environmental impact of putting art on the blockchain. The uproar reached such a peak that, before the day was done, ArtStation decided to pull the plug on its NFT initiative before it had even launched. “In light of the critical reception on social media regarding NFTs, it’s clear that now is not the right time for NFTs on ArtStation,” the company wrote in a . “We are very sorry for all the negative emotions this has caused. Despite our attempts to validate our approach, we clearly made a mistake and admit fault.” The people behind ArtStation aren’t the only ones who failed to consider the staggering carbon footprint of crypto art before attempting to cash in on the NFT gold rush. Joanie Lemercier wishes he had known about it before he sold six of his light-bending artworks as NFTs. Lemercier, a French artist turned climate activist, has spent the last few years trying to cut his annual emissions by 10 percent with significant measures like ditching air travel and integrating rainwater into his studio. His  erased the progress of those efforts in a matter of minutes. Austria-based architectural designer Chris Precht was far luckier. Right before he had made up his mind to sell 300 editions of his artwork as NFTs — with the added condition that he would plant enough trees to offset this technology’s emissions, his partner warned him: “You need Amazons, not trees to offset NFTs,” . The rise of NFTs, which are essentially certificates of ownership for any virtual asset, from pictures of a painting to tweets, has  — and understandably so. With artists facing a pandemic-fueled downturn in the absence of in-person exhibitions and auctions, NFTs have emerged as a much-needed saving grace for many. While NFTs have been around for a while, they landed in the spotlight when one of them was bought for $69 million over a month ago. Since then, NFTs of memes, , online articles, and more have racked in millions of dollars. But NFT fortune comes at a grave cost, as artists like Lemercier and Precht discovered: They’re spectacularly bad for the environment. The end-to-end transaction of a single NFT, on average, is  to emit the carbon equivalent of a two-hour flight or a month of an EU resident’s electricity consumption. This is just for trading ownership for one digital asset. The figures only get worse when you consider the multi-edition sets artists are putting up for sale. In the last month alone, over 100,000 such transactions took place on some of the leading NFT marketplaces, per a tracker site called . Lecermier’s six-edition NFT drop, which sold out in a mere 10 seconds, for instance, consumed more electricity than what his entire studio consumes in two years. Alex de Vries, a data scientist and creator of , a site that’s been tracking cryptocurrencies’ carbon footprint for years, says “cryptocurrency mining is already negating our entire net gains from deploying electric vehicles.” But NFTs are only the tip of a (melting) iceberg. The reason an NFT’s carbon footprint is so vast is because of the way its underlying platform of choice, Ethereum, works. You see, creating, say, a JPG picture on your computer won’t take up a whole lot of energy. But to forge its NFT — a unique, nontradable token of ownership for it — its information has to be “minted” onto the Ethereum blockchain, which is not at all designed to be green. Access to this information is what the person who acquires the digital asset is paying for. In order to successfully record an NFT’s information on Ehtereum and add a new block to its chain, miners need to use power-hungry computer hardware to crack complex cryptographic puzzles. The more power their computing rig has, the quicker it can solve the puzzle. The winner is rewarded with Ethereum coins, which at the time of writing, were trading for around $2,500 a pop. That may not sound like much but these machines aren’t your usual run-of-the-mill PCs. Their computations involve breaking down large math equations that can take hours or even days to complete. Not to mention this takes place on thousands of machines as everyone attempts to reach the finish line before anyone else. A single Ethereum transaction, therefore, ends up gobbling up the same amount of electricity as an average U.S. household would over 2.56 days. The NFT process from start to finish often involves multiple such transactions. To date, according to Digiconomist, Ethereum’s power consumption is equivalent to that of the entire country of New Zealand. Aurora Sharrard, director of sustainability at the University of Pittsburgh, likens the virality of NFTs to fast fashion and believes it’s not in line with our sustainability targets. “While NFTs and cryptocurrencies are means for various industries and artists to work around economic market hurdles,” she added, “environmentally speaking, they are the digital fast fashion of the day, requiring extreme amounts of electricity to produce nontangible items whose positive social benefits have not been demonstrated to exceed their negative environmental impact.” What’s worse, Ethereum’s existing system, called proof of work, is built to progressively become more complex and demand even more power as people continue to compete for it — to make it increasingly more competitive, to prevent cheating, and to shoot up prices as new blocks get scarce. Replacing this system with a more environmentally friendly one that doesn’t involve thousands of giant mining rigs guzzling energy is what most experts believe could prevent Ethereum (and other blockchain-based platforms) from killing the planet. That alternative is already here and it’s called proof of stake. In this model, Ethereum’s algorithm simply picks a miner to authenticate the new block based on how many coins they already own — eliminating the need for miners to compete and emit an enormous amount of emissions to break down the puzzle. Proof of stake has been in development for years, but the organization behind Ethereum has remained vague about its release and repeatedly postponed its launch timeline. Fortunately, the proof-of-stake model isn’t exclusive to Ethereum, and a handful of NFT marketplaces have cropped up that take advantage of proof-of-stake blockchains to offer a more eco-friendly alternative to Ethereum-based services. However, even though popular platforms like NBA Top Shot, where you can buy NFTs of NBA video highlights and trading cards, have found success in proof-of-stake blockchains, artists are wary of their volatility preventing such climate-first models from reaching the same level of popularity as Ethereum. Alice Bucknell, a London-based artist, believes the timid response towardsgreener platforms is also partly because of the “generalized lack of awareness around Ethereum’s gigantic energy consumption” and points out that “neither the currency nor mainstream NFT auction platforms are interested in making these figures transparent for the exact fear that it would scare away potential buyers with an environmental conscience.” Ethereum-based platforms like NiftyGateway and SuperRare have been unusually secretive about their carbon emissions and have refused to reveal them, forcing artists and everyone else to rely on third-party trackers. Nifty Gateway and SuperRare didn’t respond to requests fro comment from Digital Trends. Christina Akopova, co-founder of a proof-of-stake cyrpto-art marketplace called Pixeos, is nevertheless optimistic. While she agrees there’s “still a lot of education and awareness to be raised,” NFT and the blockchain industry will ultimately turn to the green side as long as reliable alternatives exist. Another approach to tackling Ethereum’s carbon-intensive process is to either power it all with clean energy or offset the emissions later. While both these options appear sound on paper, they’re easier said than done. Despite accounting for such a minuscule portion of world transactions, Ethereum is already responsible for consuming as much energy as many countries combined and is notorious for putting power plants under heavy strain. If left unchecked, environmentalists have good reason to predict that even clean energy won’t be enough to make such cryptocurrencies sustainable. “Using only renewable energy to produce cryptocurrencies is a good start,” Sharrard told Digital Trends, “but the overall energy intensity and demand of the sector also need to be considered and reduced.” In his  on renewable energy and , Digiconomist’s de Vries argues that the infrastructure for supplying clean energy is simply not adequate to handle cryptocurrency’s growing appetite. He adds that electronic waste from piles of obsolete mining chips is projected to “massively outpace e-waste creation by the banking sector.” For the time being, though, offsetting emissions may be the best way forward. On platforms like , people can select the amount of carbon they’ve spent and directly invest in a pro-climate project of their choice. Offsetra co-founder Brendan McGill claims offsetting is the most pragmatic solution right now since it’s something artists and miners can do right away instead of putting their NFT plans on hold and waiting for Ethereum’s proof-of-stake update. Environmental initiatives, McGill adds, are also in dire need of resources and they could use some from the ongoing NFT gold rush. In the long run, however, a government reform that mandates eco-friendly systems and emissions offsets might be the only option for a sustainable future of technologies like NFTs. Otherwise, reckless mining ecosystems could end risking the fate of cryptocurrency. China, for instance, recently banned the world’s largest mining hub in Inner Mongolia over fossil fuel consumption concerns. “The distraction of crypto methods that cause huge environmental and social damage isn’t good, fun entertainment — it’s wasteful fast fashion,” Sharrard said. “We only have one planet fit for human life and we need to make sure we’re not letting wasteful and harmful trends destroy the only place we can call home.”",

    "title": "Will Nvidia\u0027s \"Lite Hash Rate\" GPUs Solve Supply Woes? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " After a botched effort to limit the appeal of its  graphics cards with  Nvidia may be back with a new strategy designed to keep its GPUs in the hands of gamers. The company is rumored to be working on a refresh of its existing lineup of GeForce RTX 3000 series GPUs, which are based on the Ampere architecture. The new solution? A feature known as Lite Hash Rate (LHR), which will limit the hash rate capabilities of the card and make it unattractive for mining currencies like Ethereum. Unlike past efforts, LHR is said to be nearly impossible to bypass. In essence, Nvidia’s second software-based stab at limiting the crypto mining appeal of its GPUs is designed to keep more of its  on the market for gamers, but such a strategy may not result in a more meaningful supply of GPUs for purchase. Allegedly, the new GeForce GPUs with the new GA**2 branding will come with resizable BAR support when they ship in mid-May, according to a report on . These new cards are just updates of existing cards, like the , so they won’t come with any additional power for gaming. The main differences are that gamers won’t need to perform a vBIOS upgrade to get resizable BAR support and the addition of the new LHR feature to limit the appeal of the cards to miners. As there aren’t any notable hardware improvements, it seems that these features are software defined, with Nvidia quietly rolling out the refreshed cards to partners and retailers. The cards are expected to go on sale in June. It’s unclear if Nvidia has software-defined keys to reverse the LHR limitation on these new cards. It’s been reported that flashing an old BIOS version on the LHR cards won’t work, as there are some mechanisms in place to prevent the firmware “downgrade” from installing on the newer cards. In the past, though the RTX 3060 shipped with similar software limitations designed to make the cards less attractive to miners, the company had accidentally released a driver update that did away with the limits on cryptocurrency mining. But will it really fix the problem? It’s nearly impossible to buy an RTX 3000 GPU anywhere near retail pricing, even many, many months after the initial launch. While cryptocurrency miners are a big cause of the , they aren’t the only culprits. Nvidia, like other semiconductor players such as rival AMD, have been hampered with  meaning there are shortages of components used in making the graphics cards. Without addressing this root issue, Nvidia wouldn’t be able to increase supply in any significant manner to address the overwhelming demand for more powerful PCs, particularly ones that can play games, during the pandemic. The second issue is that scalpers are hoarding the rare supplies of GPUs, and the rising prices of graphics cards on secondary markets like eBay further constrains supplies while fueling the increase in demand. Observers have noticed that some of Nvidia GPUs are fetching twice or triple their suggested retail price on the secondary market, making it lucrative for  to snap up the GPUs as soon as inventory is replenished by authorized retailers. Furthermore, as retailers are realizing the scheme, they are also pushing prices upward through tactics such as bundling. The company had previously cautioned that GPU . Don’t get me wrong. Nvidia’s strategy is commendable, and it may help take care of part of the problem. But will it fix the supply issue at large? Not likely. It  doesn’t appear to go far enough to produce meaningful results, and gamers may still be left disappointed. However, if you are able to pick up one of the rumored new GPUs, it will come installed with some fresh features out of the box, so you won’t need to do any BIOS upgrades.",

    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrency  for the shortage of  in recent years, and the situation has become especially dire during the global pandemic when coupled with . If miners have their way, there’s another important PC component that could become scarce. It’s reported that if the new Chia cryptocurrency takes off, the PC industry and gamers may have to grapple with a shortage of storage, as inventory of hard disk drives and solid-state drives could quickly become depleted. Unlike existing cryptocurrencies, the Chia currency heavily relies on storage space, as it’s based on a “proof of space and time” model. On the other hand, currencies like Bitcoin are based on a “proof of work,” which doesn’t require as much storage. And, according to , Chia was developed by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, who wants to rely on storage as a more environmentally friendly model. Cohen’s logic is that drives like SSDs and HDDs consume less energy — compared to more  mining — and are cheaper. This should hopefully make the Chia model more accessible to miners. However, it’s this accessibility that could result in shortages of vital PC storage components. Miners already banking on scoring big with Chia have reportedly started stockpiling  and HDDs, even before the cryptocurrency is listed. Even though hard disk drives are more optimum for Chia mining — you can get more storage for less as compared to SSDs — casual miners are snapping up stock of both types of drives in anticipation for the Chia launch. In a post on , SSD manufacturer Jiahe Jinwei in China reported that it had been completely depleted of its 1TB and 2TB NVMe M.2 drives, Wcctech stated. This has prompted the company to take steps that mirror what AMD and Nvidia have taken in the GPU industry. Reportedly, Jiahe Jinwei will prevent miners from buying large numbers of solid-state drives intended for sale to consumers, and they’ll also make drives that are purpose-built for mining, a move that mirrors Nvidia’s mining-specific . In addition to making a dedicated GPU for Ethereum mining, Nvidia had also added drivers to some newer consumer  to make them less suitable for mining in an attempt to thwart cryptocurrency miners from hoarding the GPUs before gamers can buy them. Gamers already have to contend with the  in today’s market, and adding an SSD shortage could significantly drive up the cost of building a rig. Until Chia launches its cryptocurrency, it’s hard to tell the full extent of the impact on the PC storage market. If predictions pan out, prices for storage could also rapidly increase — that is, if you’re able to locate inventory of drives in the first place. In Hong Kong, Wcctech reported that pricing has so far increased by the equivalent of $26 to $76 for hard drives with capacities of 4TB to 18TB. Storage prices could continue to increase once Chia launches and becomes popular.",

    "title": "How to Mine Bitcoin | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " If you want to know how to mine Bitcoin, you can take two different steps: Go through a cloud mining company, or buy and use purpose-built hardware. We’ll look at both options and why, though neither is cheap, cloud mining represents the safest investment for your money. Remember, research is essential! As for , you need to be aware that nothing in the world of cryptocurrencies is guaranteed. Any investment could be lost, so make sure you  before pulling out your credit card and have a secure Bitcoin wallet standing by. As with all of our cryptocurrency coverage here on Digital Trends, this should not be considered financial advice. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, mining the world’s first and premier cryptocurrency needed little more than a home PC — and not even a fast one at that. Today, the entry barrier is far higher if you want to make any profit doing it. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but it’s not the homebrew industry . Before we discuss how to mine Bitcoins yourself, it’s important to note that although there is uncertainty in everything cryptocurrency-related, mining is arguably the most volatile. Hardware price fluctuations, Bitcoin-mining difficulty changes, and even the lack of a guarantee of a payout at the end of all your hard work make it a riskier investment than even buying Bitcoins directly. Because of this and general market volatility, it can be challenging to know how much profit you will make from mining. 2018 saw the mining market  and shoot up when it comes to entry barriers. Unless there’s a significant Bitcoin tech change, this is likely to stay the same. A single Bitcoin is valued at around $50,000 at present, but mining can come with high costs. In the end,  at least gives you something for your money immediately. It’s certainly worth considering before you go down the mining route. Cloud mining is the practice of renting mining hardware (or a portion of their hashing power) and having someone else do the mining for you. You are typically ‘paid’ for your investment with Bitcoin, even if the hardware isn’t used for mining Bitcoin. As with general investing, it’s essential to do your research — there are many companies out there that purport to be the best, and even the largest have their detractors. Several cloud mining companies have come and gone over the years, including ones we’ve spoken to and validated directly, like  in an interview that every one of its customers has turned a profit using its service. In early 2021, you’re far better off going with a company like , an established and respected cloud mining entity. It’s expensive to get started but one of the best options out there. For a broader range of options,  maintains a list of mining companies with user reviews and ratings, though be aware there are a lot of reviewers looking to shill their referral codes in the comment section. Once you have picked a cloud mining provider and signed up, you need to pick a mining package. That will typically involve choosing a certain amount of hashing power and cross-referencing that with how much you can afford to pay. Usually, paying more will give you a better return, or you will turn a profit quicker, but that’s not always the case. Most cloud mining companies will help you decide by giving you a calculation based on the , the difficulty of , and cross-referencing that with the hashing power you’re renting. However, it’s important to note that those numbers can and do change, so it is vital to look at market trends and estimate where Bitcoin may be going before choosing your contract. What may be profitable now may not be if Bitcoin’s value crashes. As much as companies like Coinbase offer their calculators too, we’d suggest using  to alleviate the potential for any bias that might sneak into the calculation. Some cloud mining companies will sell you a contract on a pre-sale basis — effectively asking you to pay upfront for an agreement that won’t begin for weeks or months when new hardware becomes available. In most circumstances, that is not advisable because there is no way to guarantee those contracts will be profitable when they start and not even a concrete indication of when that will happen. After choosing your contract, most cloud mining companies will ask you to pick a mining pool. That’s where you select a global mining team to join. It’s a method of increasing the chance of earning Bitcoin through mining, and it’s a standard practice in the cloud and personal mining. There are pros and cons of different pools that go beyond the scope of this article, but joining an established and proven pool with low fees is likely to be your best bet. One of the most popular and dependable pools for new miners is , but you should always do your research. Like companies, many pools aren’t trustworthy. Once you’ve completed that step, your cloud mining can begin, and within a few days or weeks, you should start to see your cloud mining account start to fill with Bitcoin. Withdrawing it and putting it into  is a good plan as soon as you have a small Bitcoin holding, though some cloud miners will allow you to reinvest your earnings for higher hashing power. Whatever you do, though, you need to decide what you’re going to do with your bitcoins in the long term. While you can purchase many products and services with bitcoins, prices can fluctuate, and you may have to do even more research to see if you’re getting a good deal. We can also help you  for a different cryptocurrency or . “HODLing,” that is, holding your Bitcoin for dear life, is also a viable strategy for some people. HODLer’s are those who hold onto their Bitcoin because they believe that their value will go up over time. Unfortunately, there is no truly reliable way to predict future values for Bitcoin, though. Of course, we aren’t financial advisors and wouldn’t suggest you do anything in particular with your Bitcoin. If you decide you want to hold onto your Bitcoin, you should consider a secure, potentially even hardware-based, wallet to store it in.   ",

    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrency mining used to be something you could do easily, but those days are long gone. Today, whether you’re mining Bitcoin, , DASH, or a host of other cryptocurrencies, the most effective way to do so is with dedicated hardware known as an ASIC miner. And even then, it’s only really for professionals with masses of capital to invest upfront. What is an ASIC miner? Short for Application-specific integrated circuit, the underlying ASIC chip is typically designed with a singular purpose, like audio processing or managing a cellphone call. In this scenario, it’s designed to “mine” a specific cryptocurrency. In a nutshell, mining is running complicated calculations in the search for a specific number. Whether it’s an ASIC miner or a GPU mining rig, mining hardware must run through many calculations before finding that number. In proof of work systems like Bitcoin, the first one to find that number gets a reward — at the time of writing, 12.5 Bitcoins worth around $96,850. That reward will fall to 6.25 Bitcoins in May 2020. There are so many people and powerful computing systems trying to  that miner groups form to find that number and share the profit. Even more, the faster your hardware, the more you earn. That’s why people who can afford it opt for ASIC miners because it gives them the greatest chance of earning cryptocurrency in exchange for their investment. Each cryptocurrency has its own cryptographic hash algorithm, and ASIC miners are designed to mine using that specific algorithm. Bitcoin ASIC miners are actually designed to calculate the. In the case of Litecoin, it uses . That means technically they could mine any other coin that’s based on the same algorithm, though typically, people who buy ASIC hardware designed for Bitcoin mine that specific digital currency. For a more in-depth look at what mining actually is, . When it comes to mining cryptocurrencies, what really matters is that the cryptocurrency you mine is worth more than what you spend on hardware and electricity. Those margins can be closer than you might think because mining cryptocurrency can be expensive. Hardware can be costly to buy upfront, and some of it can cost thousands of dollars a year in electricity to run. When choosing mining hardware, having more efficient systems is incredibly important. That’s where ASIC miners come in. They differ from a  or CPU mining system, which relies on components designed to perform more than just one task. Instead, ASIC miners are designed from the ground up to perform the calculations required by a specific cryptographic hash algorithm used by an individual or handful of cryptocurrencies. Because of this single focus, they’re incredibly efficient, powerful — offering a high “hashrate” — and energy-efficient, using far less power than a mining rig with eight graphics cards might do for the same task. This combination of performance and low-power usage makes them much more economical to run than more general-purpose hardware. In Bitcoin and Litecoin, ASIC mining is just about the only way anyone mines those cryptocurrencies. You can now get Ethereum ASIC miners too, like Bitmain’s Antminer E3 that’s already out of stock.  The base model of the S19 runs $1,785. It still delivers a commendable 95 trillion hashes per second, but at a much lower cost. Another option is the AntminerT17+, which processes 58 trillion hashes per second and only costs a little over $800.   ",

    "title": "A Very Brief History of Non Fungible Tokens or NFTs | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " If you’ve been online at any point this year, you’ve probably heard people talking about NFTs. Short for non-fungible tokens, NFTs are unique digital assets. They’re a type of cryptocurrency token. However, unlike a fungible token like , which can be swapped for other interchangeable tokens, NTFs are non-fungible, meaning that they are entirely unique. It’s a way of creating scarcity online and providing proof of authenticity and ownership. It’s most commonly applied to digital art, although it can really be applied to just about anything where uniqueness is the chief selling point. While NFTs seem like they’ve arrived out of nowhere, they do, in fact, trace back a few short years. Want to know where they come from so you can sound halfway informed the next time the subject comes up on the Clubhouse app, or when you’re asked to explain them to an elderly (read: over the age of 35) relative? You’ve come to the right place. If NFTs were a superhero movie, then Colored Coins would be the origin movie. Initially issued on the Bitcoin blockchain for as little as a single satoshi, the smallest unit of currency, Colored Coins had a lot in common with current NFTs. While not as sophisticated, the idea was to use the blockchain for assets like digital collectibles, coupons, property, company shares, and more. Colored Coins were mentioned in a 2012 article by Yoni Assia. Titled “,” it describes the new technology. Later that year, a paper from Meni Rosenfeld titled “” discussed them as the new asset class they would become. Counterparty is a peer-to-peer financial platform and open-source, distributed Internet protocol constructed on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It was among the early Bitcoin 2.0 platforms, and provided a way for users to create their own tradable currencies or assets. It was used for, among other things, meme trading, such as the . The idea of tradable collectibles on the blockchain came with an advantage not afforded to real-world rare collectibles: Counterfeiting was all but impossible. Given the problem counterfeiting poses in the world of collectibles, that was enough to get people excited. Building on the popularity of the likes of the Rare Pepe Directory, creative technologists John Watkinson and Matt Hall created a set of 10,000 unique characters on the Ethereum blockchain, whereby no two were the same. The 10,000 Cryptopunks were rapidly snapped up and traded online. The influence of the Cryptopunks project helped inspire the NFT ERC-721 standard and establish the current crypto art movement. You can follow the various trades that continue on the Cryptopunks project on a . No, the prices for the individual characters aren’t exorbitant like some of the newer NTF creations. But it certainly helped set the template. Following Cryptopunks, the next big NFT project involved cats (hey, it  the internet!). To , CryptoKitties is “a game centered around breedable, collectible, and oh-so-adorable creatures [called] CryptoKitties! Each cat is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.” Widely covered in the mainstream media, this project — which eventually spun out as a $12.5 million venture dollars-attracting startup called Dapper Labs — set the standard for NFT projects to come. As of the date this article was published, the most a single CryptoKitty has ever sold for is $390,000. A decentralized, Ethereum-based VR platform,  lets players buy up empty parcels of 3D virtual space, measuring 10 meters by 10 meters. Its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) raked in a massive $26 million in just half a minute. In Decentraland, gamers can explore, build, play games, collect items, and more. Imagine , but for denizens of Burning Man instead of 13-year gamers, and you won’t be a million miles away. There’s an old saying that you know you’re in a financial bubble when your cab driver starts giving you investment advice. Similarly, you know that NFTs have gone mainstream when major rock bands start releasing their albums on NFT. That’s what happened in March when Kings of Leon announced that they were  to release its latest album, , on NFT. That’s far from the only NFT milestone. Jack Dorsey, co-founder, and CEO of Twitter is , “just setting up my twttr,” via a platform called Valuables. Tech entrepreneur Justin Sun has so far offered him $2.5 million for it. Meanwhile, in February, Grimes, musician, and partner of Elon Musk, sold some . And things are just getting started …",

    "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin with PayPal | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  is much easier today than it was in the past, but it would still be easier if you could just use your Paypal account, wouldn’t it? It turns out if you try to do that, it’s a bit more tricky — and much more expensive. One of the main reasons why it’s difficult is the potential for chargebacks. Major exchanges won’t allow PayPal transactions because it would be too easy for people to buy Bitcoins, then use PayPal’s support system to chargeback their purchase and receive their original purchase fee back. That would be an improper and fraudulent way to buy Bitcoin — even when using the services below — so it’s not encouraged in any manner. However, it is possible to use Paypal to buy Bitcoin, even if it’s less advisable than using an exchange directly. Before you can receive any Bitcoin, regardless of payment method, you need to have a  set up, as well as a PayPal account. Once you do that, you’ll be ready to move ahead and start  with PayPal. Sort of. As much as Paypal makes buying Bitcoin easier, you don’t do it in the same manner as you do on exchanges or direct trades; you effectively buy a Bitcoin IOU. You can buy and sell Bitcoin on Paypal, but you can’t withdraw your Bitcoin to another wallet of your choosing. You can only cash it out by converting to fiat currency first. A popular Bitcoin mantra comes to mind with this: “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t have direct ownership over the wallet that the Bitcoin is stored in, you don’t really own Bitcoin. As much as Paypal does now allow you to use funds to invest in cryptocurrency in some sense, the lack of direct control over your investment is worrisome and may mean it’s better to. As of November 11, 2020, eligible PayPal users can hold, buy, and sell cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The company has also announced plans to allow cryptocurrency as a funding source for users to make purchases on any PayPal merchant. You can either do it directly from PayPal’s mobile app and selecting  or , then proceed to buy any of the previous cryptocurrencies for as little as $1 with no middlemen or exchange fees to deal with. Because cryptocurrency exchanges don’t allow you to buy Bitcoin with PayPal, the best way to do so is direct trade. Websites that facilitate these kinds of peer-to-peer transactions help put you in touch with someone looking to sell Bitcoins who accepts PayPal as a payment method. For example, there are many Bitcoin Cash sellers (BCH) who might be willing to accept payment via a PayPal transaction. However, buyers and sellers should choose their exchanges with care and ensure their choice offers features like identity verification, enhanced privacy, and information security. Since 2018, the popular exchange Coinbase partnered with PayPal to purchase Bitcoins via credit and debit cards and transfer funds from Bitcoin sales to PayPal wallets. Two other main websites for conducting these kinds of transactions are  and . Both offer many payment methods for Bitcoin, from gift cards to cash, but PayPal is a popular choice. To buy Bitcoin with PayPal on either service, follow the steps below:  Head to the homepage of LocalBitcoins or Paxful and sign up for an account.  Use the respective site’s search tools to select the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy (or USD you want to spend), with PayPal as your preferred payment option.  Choose an offer based on the relative Bitcoin price, user rating, or customer reviews. Click the  button on the right-hand side.  Make sure to read the specific terms of the deal with your chosen seller — some request ID, others a contact number.  If you are happy with their stipulations, confirm the amount of Bitcoin to buy and click the large  button to continue the transaction.  You will gain direct contact with the seller. The specifics of the transactions will be up to you to discuss and confirm with them. Once the process is complete and sent to your payment using PayPal, your newly acquired Bitcoin will be sent to your specified wallet. Although no exchanges will accept PayPal transactions, one website offers a more automated system than the pure direct trade sites outlined above.  operates what it describes as a Bitcoin secured loan system, whereby it allows Bitcoin owners to , who can then do with it what they will. They loan it in exchange for payment, and one of those payment options is PayPal. XCoins touts itself for offering low fees for Bitcoin purchases, though you pay a lender’s fee for the convenience of using its service, which at its lowest is 15%. You also pay a “loan origination fee,” at 7.5% of your investment, and a PayPal processing fee of several percentage points, plus a flat rate of a few cents on top of that. As with buying through direct trade websites, PayPal transactions on Xcoins are not cheap.  Head to the  and click  in the top menu.  Sign up for an account and verify it with the link emailed to you.  Set up two-factor authentication through your mobile device.  Input the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy in Bitcoin or your chosen currency. Xcoins will then search for a suitable lender for your transaction.  When a lender has been found, you’ll be shown the details of the transaction, including processing and lender fees. If you are happy to go ahead with the purchase based on those figures, read the linked loan agreement and tick the corresponding box to show you have done so. Then click . \n\n You will then be redirected to your PayPal account, where you will need to log in and validate the transaction as usual.  Once you have returned to Xcoins, your Bitcoin will be sent straight to your Xcoins wallet, at which point you can send it to a more secure wallet of your choice.",

    "title": "At $1 Trillion, Bitcoin\u0027s Value Is Almost the Same as Google | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The price of  has surged in recent days, sending the cryptocurrency value soaring. With a high value of $53,750 per coin as traded on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, the combined value of all existing coins is now $1 trillion dollars. This means that Bitcoin’s market capitalization rivals some of the top and most well-known technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is valued at $1.42 trillion, for comparison, putting Bitcoin within striking distance of it if the cryptocurrency’s price continues to rise, while Amazon’s current market capitalization is $1.67 trillion and Microsoft’s value sits at $1.82 trillion. At $1 trillion, Bitcoin’s market value when counting all the coins in circulation, is double what the currency’s value was at the start of 2021. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin was at $500 million. So in a little more than two months time, Bitcoin’s combined earn market value is nearly the same as  and embarrassing $500 million blunder. However, for Bitcoin to catch up to Apple, which is the world’s most valuable company, it would have to once again double today’s valuations. Apple’s market capitalization stands at $2.18 trillion. The rise in Bitcoin’s value is also spilling into other adjacent cryptocurrencies, as Ethereum mining is also picking up steam. To the disdain of gamers, miners of the  have been snapping up hard-to-find  to build their . The situation got so bad that Nvidia was forced to create software locks on its most recent GPUs to deter miners and try to reserve the limited inventory of graphics cards for the company’s gaming customers. Separately, Nvidia also created a  specific for Ethereum mining. The cryptocurrency market has experienced a renewed interest in recent months. Notably, Tesla had made a $1.5 billion bet on Bitcoin, with CEO Elon Musk saying that cryptocurrency is slightly better than holding cash. “Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S\u0026P500 company,” Musk wrote in a tweet, noting that Tesla’s recent moves in the cryptocurrency market are “not directly reflective of my opinion.” Tesla also announced that it will also accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its electric vehicles. That said, Musk doesn’t seem as enthusiastic about Bitcoin as the company he helms. “To be clear, I am not an investor, I am an engineer,” the CEO said in a subsequent tweet. “I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is ‘almost.\u0027” Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, however, takes a more neutral view on Bitcoin, according to his statement in a recent  interview. Gates admitted that he, however, doesn’t own Bitcoin, opting instead to focus his energy on his philanthropic endeavors. Analysts still appear divided on their view of Bitcoin. Some claim that breaking the $1 trillion asset cap could lead the currency to climb higher — even as high as $200 trillion or $400 trillion, according to Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Kippsten in a reportby . Others, like analysts from JP Morgan, view the meteoric rise as unsustainable. Aside from corporations and institutional investors, there have been a lot of new individuals who are finding interest in cryptocurrency, with crytpcurrency exchange company Binance citing more than 300,000 new user registrations daily and volumes that are even higher than at the currency’s former peak in 2017, according to a  report.",

    "title": "With CMP Launch, Nvidia Steers Crypto Miner Away From GPUs | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Given that gamers have been unsuccessfully competing against  for GPUs amid a shortage of graphics cards, Nvidia is making some changes that will make the entry-level  less attractive to miners. Don’t worry, pricing for the base  in Nvidia’s RTX 3000 series remains the same, but Nvidia is limiting the hash rate of the RTX 3060 to make it less appealing for use as a miner. “With the launch of GeForce RTX 3060 on February 25, we’re taking an important step to help ensure GeForce GPUs end up in the hands of gamers,” the company wrote in a , noting that “we designed GeForce GPUs for gamers, and gamers are clamoring for more.” The limits on hash rates will be controlled by Nvidia’s GeForce software drivers, which will detect when the card will be used for Ethereum mining. Once the drivers detect that a mining algorithm is in play, Nvidia claims that it would limit the hash rate, which would then limit the mining efficiency for cryptocurrency by approximately 50%. “That only makes sense,” the company said in defending its solution. Nvidia claims that it is applying smart driver-based limits to the hash rate only when it detects mining algorithms to make the gamer-designed GPU less attractive to cryptocurrency miners and give more gamers and creatives a chance to be able snag the $399 graphics cards if they desire. “Our GeForce RTX GPUs introduce cutting-edge technologies — such as RTX real-time , , Reflex superfast response rendering for the best system latency, and many more — tailored to meet the needs of gamers and those who create digital experiences.” Nvidia’s latest move is good news for the gaming community, as we’ve seen pre-order pricing for the RTX 3060 already  ahead of the card’s February 25 availability. The desktop GPU was initially announced earlier this year during , and it will come with the same  and second-generation ray tracing core design found in Nvidia’s other RTX 3000 series GPUs. In addition to solidifying the RTX 3060 as an arsenal for gaming, Nvidia also announced a new Nvidia CMP card, which stands for Cryptocurrency Mining Processor. Without a , miners were turning to dedicated gaming GPUs to do the work, but with the new CMP card, Nvidia hopes that miners will have a powerful tool to do the task and leave the GeForce RTX cards to gamers. The CMP cards aren’t designed for graphics, Nvidia claimed, and the CMPs also lack display outputs. This helps to improve airflow and cooling while mining, and the design is intentional to allow the cards to be densely packed together in a mining rig. “Creating tailored products for customers with specific needs delivers the best value for customers,” the company stated. “With CMP, we can help miners build the most efficient data centers while preserving GeForce RTX GPUs for gamers.” Nvidia’s CMPs will be sold through authorized partners, though the company did not disclose how much these mining-specific cards will cost.",

    "detailContent": " Even though internet and cyber cafes may have bene shuttered during pandemic-imposed lockdowns, it doesn’t mean these small businesses aren’t making money. In fact, even with the lack of the familiar faces of gaming customers during the shutdown, some of these cyber cafes are making more money now than ever before. Owners of cyber cafes in Asia, once a destination for gamers and travelers paying for access to a computer, have used their entrepreneurial skills to pivot to a new business model amid the shutdown. For example, the owner of the Computer Star cyber cafe in Vietnam converted the gaming destination into a cryptocurrency mining farm, according to a report on . For the mining operation, the owner of Computer Star utilized a few of Nvidia’s hard-to-get  flagship . In fact, pent-up demand for  of cards from gamers and cryptocurrency miners — in addition to component shortages throughout the supply chain — created a massive GPU shortage in late 2020 that has extended into this year. The key to success here is changing from a business that serves gamers by the hour to converting existing PC hardware into an operation that can mine for cyptocurrency. Given that many of these locations already have capable graphics cards since they had previously catered to a gaming audience, the conversion to a new model for operating was relatively easy. Both Nvidia and rival AMD do not expect the shortage issues to ease up until the middle of this year at the earliest, and many gamers have so far been unable to get their hands on the former’s GeForce RTX 3000 line and the latter’s  graphics cards. Unfortunately, by pivoting to running a crypto mining farm, many cyber cafes that once served gamers are finding themselves competing against those customers at a time when graphics cards are already hard to come by. Gamers frustrated by the great GPU shortage have been blaming cryptocurrency miners for hoarding what little inventory there is to begin with. In one instance, a cryptocurrency miner used a rig of  to generate an estimated monthly revenue of $20,000 in Ethereum earnings.  are also to blame for the shortages, as they make lucrative profits off reselling the in-demand GPUs on secondary markets, like eBay.",

    "detailContent": " Bitcoin might still be considered the flagship cryptocurrency that many other alternative currencies sail in the wake of, but that’s not to say it’s the only viable one. With more than 2,000 different cryptocurrencies out there, knowing which ones to put your money into isn’t easy. Do you opt for one with a low price so you can buy a lot of them in the hopes of making a fortune? Do you buy the ones with low transaction fees or confirmation times to speed up transfers? We’ll give you the best Bitcoin alternatives based on features and current values. Whether you’re looking to use your cryptocurrency to pay for items online or want to put some aside to create a crypto-nest egg, these are the best Bitcoin alternatives. Note: Digital Trends’ information and opinion should in no way be considered investment advice, and we cannot be held liable for personal or business losses based on market changes or other outside factors. Before we get into actually recommending alternative , we have to make something abundantly clear. Investing in any cryptocurrencies, be they new or established, is more akin to gambling than the traditional stock market. Prices can be extremely volatile, and though we don’t think  for the scene, it’s still possible, and nobody knows for sure. Despite cryptocurrency holdings not having the relative reliability of traditional investments, the IRS taxes them in the same way. To clarify, just like if you buy stocks and have them for over a year before selling them, cryptocurrency investors must pay long-term capital gains taxes. This official guidance means that any profits you accrue will face a 15% tax rate — individuals making over $425,800 per year and couples making over $479,000 per year pay a 20% tax rate cryptocurrency earnings. If you look around online, though, you will find plenty of people looking to advise people to invest in “sure things.” It might be , or a new initial coin offering looking for funding. That’s not what we’re doing here, and we have no bridges in Brooklyn or Eiffel Towers to sell you. While the ceiling for profit is certainly higher on new cryptocurrencies, which you can pick up at a fraction of a dollar, we review established coins that are less likely to bottom out and ruin your investment. We’ll be looking at verified coins that have proved themselves over time as viable stores of value and transactional mediums. As much as Bitcoin had a great 2017, Ethereum’s year was just as impressive. It went from a currency worth single digits at the start of the year to worth more than $1,200 in the early days of the next. It also proved itself to have a higher ceiling (at least for now) than Bitcoin in handling transactions. In early 2018, more than four times the number of Ethereum transactions took place every day, and they happened far faster than Bitcoin. Transaction costs are much lower too, which makes quite a difference when dealing with multiple trades. Currently, Bitcoin has been storming into 2021 with an eye-popping $40,000 valuation after increasing in value by 400% in 2020. There is speculation that single Bitcoin values could become as high as $50,000, but this has not yet materialized, and the market is still coming to terms with the new reality. Ethereum is valued at around $1,145 at present, but some analysts predict that it could be worth over $10,000 per coin and gain a 25% market share in the future. Although some experts we spoke to believe still that s, rising in value and usefulness in the years to come, there’s no denying it faces some difficulties.  and newer altcoins have fixed some of those potential problems, at least in the short term. Ethereum hasn’t yet hit the scaling issues that Bitcoin has encountered, sending fees skyrocketing. It also incorporates additional features like smart contracts, which could make Ethereum and its currency, Ether, the preferred cryptocurrency for various industries in the future. Like many other altcoins on this list, many cryptocurrency investors wish they’d bought a lot of  at the start of 2017. In January of that year, you could purchase individual Litecoins for $4 a pop, but they grew to more than $350 each at their peak at year’s end. Although there is no guarantee (as with any cryptocurrency) that Litecoin will one day reach or even exceed that height, the relatively low-price at the time of writing (about $138) makes it a popular investment choice. Compared with the likes of Bitcoin, Litecoin is preferable for regular transactions, featuring a block time 75% faster than Bitcoin and transaction fees at a fraction of a dollar. More and more developers and merchants are beginning to accept Litecoin too. Although Litecoin doesn’t have the same potential as Ethereum in building new transaction platforms, as one of the longest-running cryptocurrencies (created in 2011), it’s an established altcoin with great name recognition. It’s one of the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market cap and has a larger trading volume than all but Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Although Ripple certainly had its detractors for being a somewhat , there’s no denying that Ripple had some real potential thanks to its rising value and industry support. Ripple’s value spiked at the end of 2017, moving from around $0.20 in October to more than $2.50 at year’s end. It often stood out from some of the other large market-value cryptocurrencies in that it tends to rise when they fall and vice versa. Ripple and its transactional protocol, XRP, show a lot of potential for those looking to make money from their investment. Given its support from major banking organizations, Ripple has a unique place at the near-top of the cryptocurrency pile. Backed by Santander, RBC, American Express, and other financial institutions, Ripple technology is already being leveraged by some groups for international wealth transfers. MoneyGram announced a  in 2018 to use XRP for some of its payment flows. Unfortunately, due to the SEC filing a lawsuit against Ripple for selling over a billion dollars in unregistered securities, many major financial backers and investor institutions are dissolving their XRP assets, which has led to a downfall in its price and confidence in its future. You might wonder what something called Bitcoin Cash is doing on a list of best Bitcoin alternatives, but don’t worry, you’re not seeing things. Bitcoin Cash is a forked version of Bitcoin, meaning that it is a separate currency with a valuation of $473 per coin at the time of writing. Created in 2017 in response to Bitcoin’s long transaction times and lack of scalability, Bitcoin Cash further split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV in 2018. However, Bitcoin’s superior security and market cap make it hard for anyone else to break through, even an altcoin. That being said, Bitcoin Cash is a great way to dip your toe into cryptocurrencies without losing your shirt in the process. A single Monero token is worth around $169 at the time of writing, which is still a significant increase over its roughly $9 value at the start of 2017. Although considered an alternative coin,  than Bitcoin. This difference ultimately means that Monero has greater privacy for owners as a core component of its technology. Monero achieves advanced privacy by hiding specific transaction elements, like the receiving address and the amount transmitted. That’s somewhat different from Bitcoin, which has an entirely public ledger that makes tracing Bitcoin across the network rather easy, although time-consuming. For those who like the privatizing elements of Monero, it can facilitate direct purchases from fellow evangelists and on some websites. However, the range of mainstream purchase solutions is limited for the time being. As even the least meme-familiar among us may remember, the internet was gifted with Kabosu in 2013, the highly critical Shiba Inu now widely known as Doge. You may not know that the very same year, two gentlemen named Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created  as a joke cryptocurrency to honor the famous canine. Little did they expect that Dogecoin would become so popular in early 2014 that it’s capitalization reached $60 million. In 2020, the value of Dogecoin was just fractions of a cent per token — that is until Elon Musk tweeted about this almost forgotten currency to troll Bitcoin, causing Dogecoin’s value to spike from $0.003 to $0.005. It did crest a cent at one point, but currently sits at just over $0.009 per token. Regardless, the user community surrounding Dogecoin is known for its friendliness and sense of humor, which cannot be said of every cryptocurrency. While some hope and speculate that the value may rise to its former lofty heights, Dogecoin is an excellent way for cryptocurrency novices to learn the ropes of mining before moving on to higher-value coins and more significant risks.",

The safest way of doing this is to invest in a hardware wallet, and arguably the best such wallets are made by French manufacturer Ledger. You may notice that Ledger offers two hardware wallets, though: The Ledger Nano S and the Ledger Nano X. Which one is best? In this article, we answer this question, comparing the Ledger Nano S and X. We highlight the main differences between the two and explain the rationale for choosing one over the other. This should help you decide which is the right device for you. Aside from the fact that the Ledger Nano X is roughly double the price of the S ($120 vs. $60), there are two main differences between the devices. The first is that the Ledger Nano S supports up to 20 apps, while the Nano X supports up to 100. By “app,” we mean the software needed to receive and send any given cryptocurrency. If you want to store Bitcoin, you’ll need to download the Bitcoin app onto your Ledger. If you want to store Ethereum, you’ll need to download the Ethereum app, and so on. This means that, if the only cryptocurrency you own (and intend to own) is bitcoin, you can get by with the Ledger Nano S. The other difference between the two is that the Ledger Nano X supports Bluetooth, while the S does not. Because it supports a Bluetooth connection, you can connect and use the Ledger Nano X with Ledger’s  app (Ledger Live). In other words, you can send Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using the Nano X while on the go. By contrast, with the Nano S, you have to connect the wallet directly to your computer to use it, by using the supplied Micro-B USB cable (the X comes with its own USB C-cable for its wired connection option). If you’re someone who travels — and trades crypto — often, this connectivity is likely to be very important. However, if you’ve bought only one or two cryptocurrencies and intend to hold onto them for the long term, the Ledger Nano S should suffice. The Ledger Nano S and X are largely identical from a security standpoint. While the X uses the newer ST33 secure element and the S uses the ST31, both chips have been independently certified by the ANSSI (the French National Cybersecurity Agency). As such, they’re both more or less as secure as each other, so you needn’t think that you’re somehow skimping on safety by opting for the cheaper Nano S. It’s also worth pointing out that, with both the Ledger Nano S and X, only public data is communicated to your computer or smartphone. The private keys controlling your cryptocurrencies are never transmitted by either device, and neither is the seed phrase you can use to restore your device in the event of damage, destruction, or loss. This is good to know, particularly with the Ledger Nano X, which can use Bluetooth to communicate with your . As with performance, the Ledger Nano S and X are mostly similar when it comes to their designs, with both devices featuring a stainless steel case that can be pivoted to reveal the black plastic wallet underneath. The Nano S is a little smaller, measuring at 57 x 17.4 x 9.1 mm, while the X comes in at 72 x 18.6 x 11.75 mm. This means that the X is about 26% taller, 7% wider, and 29% thicker. It’s also roughly twice as heavy, at 34g versus 16.2g (about 1.1 oz and 0.56 oz). However, it’s still pretty light and easy to handle, so you’ll hardly notice any difference in practice. The Nano X also looks fractionally more refined. The S comes with two small buttons that protrude out slightly from its side, and which are used to scroll through options and confirm actions (with a simultaneous press of both). By contrast, the X’s flat circular buttons are placed more discreetly on either side of its screen. They’re flush against the face of the wallet, so they don’t stick out like the S’s. The Nano X also boasts a higher resolution screen, not that you’ll be watching videos or looking at photos on it. It packs 128 x 64 pixels, whereas the S offers only 128 x 32. Ultimately, the question of whether to buy a Ledger Nano S or a Ledger Nano X comes down to how many cryptocurrencies you hold and how often you trade. If you own only one or two and don’t plan on trading them frequently, then the Ledger Nano S is probably your best bet. Conversely, if you hold multiple cryptocurrencies (particularly if you hold 20 or more), and if you want the ability to send crypto while on the move, then the Ledger Nano X is the better choice. These differences aside, both devices remain highly secure hardware wallets. If you’re planning on holding a significant quantity of crypto for the medium- or long-term, either one is a must.",

Pictured in a photo that has been widely circulated on , the mining rig — named Berta 2 and created by Simon Byrne — is shown with its illuminated. colorful RGB backlight, according to reports on  and . The mining rig is reportedly able to generate approximately $20,000 of income each month in  currency. Based on current pricing for Ethereum, each graphics card, according to , can generate approximately $6.35 to $9.15 per day, including the cost of electricity.  estimated that it costs $1,444 per month just to power Byrne’s rig — and that’s not accounting for cooling costs — based on rates in Las Vegas, where he resides. As a whole, Byrne’s system can generate between $15,000 and $21,000 in income on average each month. Still, 78 units of  come at a hefty cost, and the rig itself is valued at an estimated $100,000. Each graphics card has a starting price of $699, and custom variants cost more. This means that it will take on average about half a year for Byrne to break even and begin generating revenue. With the fluctuating exchange rate for cryptocurrency, the return on investment could take significantly longer than half a year. Byrne — and by proxy, Bitcoin miners — alone may not be the sole reason why GPUs have been in high demand and short supply. Nvidia executives have cited the unprecedented demand due to situations created by the ongoing health pandemic that is forcing more people to work, learn, and keep entertained at home. To do so, they’re turning to technology, like stronger processors and video cards, to fuel their productivity and entertainment needs. Nvidia’s theory, and its supply shortage, was shared by rivals, including AMD, which also experienced shortages of both its recently launched  and its . Despite retailers’ best attempts to restock Nvidia’s GPUs and AMD’s CPUs and GPUs, these PC parts quickly sell out. When the cards initially launched,  were blamed for wiping out the very first batches of inventory. Though AMD has been less vocal about the cause for the shortages, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress recently said that shortages in the company’s supply chain — widely believed to be shortages of GDDR6 memory — are also contributing to shortages for graphics cards. Though the RTX 3080 and the enthusiast-class RTX 3090 rely on more advanced GDDR6X memory, Nvidia’s other RTX 3000 series cards and AMD’s recent Radeon cards use the GDDR6 standard. Kress speculated that the .  aren’t without blame. Prior to the launch of AMD’s Radeon RX 6000 series and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3000 series cards, Bitcoin miners were often blamed for wiping out GPU supplies. The shortages angered gamers and dedicated Nvidia fans so much that  during a media session at the company’s GTC conference in 2018, noting that cryptocurrency mining “is not our business” while simultaneously declaring that Nvidia stands with gamers. ““We’re not involved in Bitcoin at all,” Huang said. “Bitcoin [mining] is done largely by ASICs today.” Despite distancing himself from controversy, Huang didn’t shy away from promoting the strength of the GPU over  or even the CPU. “The reason why the GPU is so popular with Ethereum is because the GPU is the single-largest distributed supercomputer in the world,” he said. “It is the only supercomputer that is literally in everyone’s hands. And as a result, no single entity can control currency.” At the end of the day, demand for GPUs is soaring because they generate money. For creatives and gamers, GPUs are an integral tool, while Bitcoin miners find that the investment can often pay off.",

According to a , the oil drilling giant has opened a crypto mining farm that runs on gas energy. The crypto farm is located in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of northwestern Siberia. It is utilizing gas from a nearby oil field as an energy source, which is turned into electricity for the mining process using its own power plant. While Gazprom Neft will not be doing the mining itself, it reportedly plans to open up its resources to miners and piloted a small-scale mining operation with the mining company Vekus this fall. Gazprom Neft aims to increase the size of the mining farm, although it has not revealed how large it plans for the farm to grow.  is the . Mining has to be done using specialized computers, with miners solving a computational problem in order to chain together blocks of transactions (the so-called blockchain), for which they are rewarded with fresh Bitcoin. , the energy consumption associated with mining Bitcoin is equivalent to seven gigawatts of energy, approximately 0.21% of the world’s energy supply, or the equivalent of the power consumption of Switzerland. The Siberian Bitcoin farm solves two problems at once. The first is that it provides a new means of generating large amounts of almost free electricity for the energy-intensive process of mining cryptocurrency. The second problem it solves is that it helps deal with a byproduct of the oil drilling process, which can result in fines. The extraction of oil also results in the release of CO2. Instead of wasting this gas, using it to generate electricity is a valuable method of repurposing it. In one month, 49,500 cubic meters of natural gas have reportedly been used to mine 1.8 Bitcoin. At current trading prices, that is equivalent to more than $52,000. That’s not a bad return on investment — especially now that it sounds like a lot of the necessary infrastructure has been set up.",

Before that, the value dropped even lower, to $18,313, according to data seen on . The value is often hard to predict, and it does not always sway with world events like stock prices often do. This rise, and then drop, in value could also be attributed to hoarding (or “hodling”), and a rush to invest or “mine” the cryptocurrency . It is not uncommon, though, as when Bitcoin hit its previous high value in December of 2017, it saw prices drop thousands of dollars just a few months later. Still, since Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, it does have an impact on many others on the market.

    "detailContent": " Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is suing YouTube and Google for videos on their platform that use his likeness in cryptocurrency giveaway scams. In a  filed in the Superior Court of California on Tuesday, Wozniak claims that the videos used his likeness without his permission. He and 17 others are suing YouTube and its parent company, Google, over the video scams. “As a result of defendants’ egregious failures to act and affirmative misconduct in promoting this criminal enterprise, plaintiff Wozniak has suffered, and continues to suffer, irreparable harm to his reputation, and YouTube users, including plaintiffs, have been defrauded out of millions of dollars,” the filing reads. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube has “refused or failed” to take the scam videos down from the platform and even provided paid advertising to the videos. The filing includes screenshots of several separate YouTube videos that show Wozniak’s face attached to a 5,000 Bitcoin giveaway. YouTube does have tools that users can use to report channels or videos that are impersonating their likeness and removed 2.2. million videos for violating its spam policies in the the first three months of 2020 alone. “We take abuse of our platform seriously, and take action quickly when we detect violations of our policies, such as scams or impersonation,” a YouTube spokesperson said in regards to the lawsuit. Digital Trends also reached out to Wozniak’s team to comment on the lawsuit. We will update this story when we hear back. The filing comes one week after  where celebrities, billionaires, and companies apparently posted messages offering anyone thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. Twitter looked into the situation within an hour after the fake tweets began and eventually locked all verified accounts for two hours as a precautionary measure. The company said it believes the hack had been made possible by  who had access to Twitter’s internal systems and tools. Tuesday’s filing said that Twitter acted “swiftly and decisively” in shutting down crypto giveaway hacks and said that YouTube “has been unapologetically hosting, promoting, and directly profiting from similar scams.”",

A Twitter spokesperson told Digital Trends that it was looking into the issue but could not provide additional details.

    "detailContent": " While all cryptocurrencies are a little different from one another, Ripple stands apart with its backing by major banks. That’s lead to some exciting partnerships, which in turn  and its transactional protocol, XRP, to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share in early 2018. Although most exchanges for cryptocurrencies will let you store your newly acquired digital currencies with them, that’s not an ideal place to leave it. Just like with Bitcoin, picking a secure wallet is an essential step in your Ripple-buying journey. This wallet is where you’re going to store your XRP after purchase, so you aren’t susceptible to exchange outages, hacks, or thefts. While there aren’t quite as many viable XRP wallets as there are  there are some great ones that we can recommend.  This freely available Ripple wallet is compatible with , iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems and offers reliable security with robust backup options. It’s software-based, so you are somewhat reliant on the protection level of your device, but it’s more convenient than a hardware wallet and free too. As such, you might want to consider  for added privacy and defense.  If you take your Ripple security seriously or plan to buy a lot of it, then a hardware wallet is a great way to secure your new purchase. At around $100, it’s much cheaper than its touchscreen alternative, the Ledger Blue. It is a little more complicated to set up than a software solution, but it’s about the safest you can make your cryptocurrency without springing for a safety deposit box too. There are many different exchanges out there, and a good number of them accept trades in XRP but not all of them are reputable. You can find several sanctioned exchanges on the  but for this guide, we’ll be using the long-standing . First, sign up for an account on Kraken and select a secure password (save it in ). Then, activate your account via your email and login. Once you’re on your account page, navigate to the verification tab and follow the on-screen instructions. You’ll need to verify your account to at least Tier 3 to deposit fiat currency funds like USD so that you can make a trade. For Tier 3, you’ll need to provide a proof of address, which can take 1-5 days to verify. Other countries may not require such steep verification. Once verified, click your account name in the top-right and select  from the drop-down menu. Select your local currency from the left-hand menu followed by your transfer preference from the drop-down menu. Follow the on-screen instructions to send your fiat currency to your Kraken account. Note that transfer times can take up to five days in some cases, though in most will be complete within one or two. When your account is primed and ready, click on the trade tab and select . Select the currency you want to buy and the one you want to use to make the purchase and input how much you want to buy or spend. Take note of the market rates and when you’re happy with your intended purchase, hit the green  with the button. Doing so will make a market trade at the best available rate. If you would rather, you can place a , which only makes a trade at a specified price or better. If all goes to plan, your XRP will then transfer to your Kraken wallet. Once you have your XRP, you want to avoid problems like the exchange going down or getting hacked. It’s time to move your newly acquired Ripple to your previously prepared wallet. Whether it’s a software or hardware wallet, you should have complete control over your new cryptocurrency. To do so, click your account name in the top right-hand corner and select . Then choose XRP from the list of currencies on the left-hand menu. On the next page, follow the on-screen instructions to add the address of your off-exchange wallet. Save it, select it from the drop-down menu, then choose how much of your XRP you want to transfer away. When ready, click the green  button. Details of the transaction should then appear on the withdrawal page, letting you know the state of transfer. It may not happen immediately but shouldn’t take more than a few hours to appear on your off-exchange wallet. The above methods are the only current ways to buy XRP with your real-world money. If you already have cryptocurrencies like Ether or bitcoin, you can use asset exchange sites to trade one for another quite swiftly. For a full breakdown of the methods involved in that, check out our guide on .

That’s why, if you’re thinking of investing in Ripple, you need to do your research first. What better place to start than right here? Want to know what Ethereum is all about too? . Ripple is the catchall name for the cryptocurrency platform, the transactional protocol for which is XRP. This is much in the same fashion as Ethereum is the name for the platform that facilitates trades in Ether. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any single centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of Bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time. Initially founded by a single company, Ripple continues to be backed by it, rather than the more extensive network of developers that continue Bitcoin’s development. It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit. On the other hand, Ripple launched with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number , and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count. Even at the , that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on approximately $12 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and . In actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the commercial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense. You may have heard a lot of cryptocurrency investors and financial commentators discussing the idea of regulation. While , many worry about banks cracking down on Bitcoin and the like. That’s even less likely to happen with Ripple, as it’s backed by some of the world’s major financial institutions. Santander, UBS, American Express, RBC, Westpac, and more, all have a hand in its operation and proliferation. They can even charge their specified fees for completing transactions. That control is the most significant differentiating factor for Ripple. In many ways, this isn’t wholly surprising, as  for companies that can employ it effectively. However, backing a cryptocurrency like Ripple is undoubtedly an outlier. It is something that needs to be understood by potential buyers and sellers because it gives those financial institutions a much higher level of control over Ripple than most other cryptocurrencies out there. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar are entirely decentralized, backed by thousands if not millions of global miners, meaning that nobody has any real control over the network. In contrast, these financial institutions and Ripple Labs itself manage Ripple’s nodes. Those independent servers don’t have to provide proof-of-work calculations like Bitcoin. The nodes simply validate transactions themselves – much like traditional banks do. When that’s combined with the fact that no new XRP will be created and existing numbers’ circulation is strictly controlled, it leads many to have concerns about Ripple’s future. All of that control of the Ripple network that’s held by particular entities means that they have some abilities which are unique to this sort of cryptocurrency. The one that has detractors concerned the most is the “freeze.” “The XRP Ledger gives addresses the ability to freeze non-XRP balances, which can be useful to meet regulatory requirements, or while investigating suspicious activity,” the  reads. While that is commonplace in traditional banking, many would argue it is the complete opposite of the real purpose of cryptocurrencies: to remove that regulation and oversight. Effectively, Ripple nodes can severely limit XRP wallets on an individual basis, or all wallets associated with a particular node.  when original Ripple Labs founder Jed McCaleb attempted to sell more than a million dollars worth of Ripple. Ripple Labs purportedly persuaded a Ripple node, Bitstamp, to reverse the transaction. There are elements to the story which suggest McCaleb breached a contract with the sale. Regardless, the fact that the freeze was possible at all – with centralized authorities controlling the currency’s owner’s ability to transact with it as he wishes – has others concerned for Ripple’s future. If the founding company, exchanges, and banks can control XRP to that extent, is it worth trading in Ripple at all? At the very least, it’s essential to be aware that where other cryptocurrencies give the owners near-complete control over their coins — as long as you use the e — Ripple has much more significant oversight and middle-man control. At present time McCaleb is estimated to have sold off at least a billion XRP between 2014 and 2019. He also retains almost five percent of the overall token supply (4.7 billion), and sold over  in January of 2020. Given that the financial decisions of Ripple’s founder can have such a profound impact, let alone those of Ripple Labs itself, investors may be understandably skittish.",

    "detailContent": "   But which alternative currencies should you consider investing in? We have our favorites, but if you want to put your eggs into one specific basket, you need to look at the differences between some of the best options. What about if we pit Litecoin against Ethereum — which one comes out on top? Litecoin has been around a lot longer than Ethereum, but Ether has grown in value far quicker. Then there are smart contracts to consider. In this guide, we’ll break down the key differences between these two altcoins, to give you the best basis for your choice of cryptocurrency investment. However, it should be noted that the information that Digital Trends provides should not be considered as financial advice, and we cannot be held responsible for market forces and other unforeseen developments. If you’d rather skip all that and just look at  or trade your coins for something else, we have . With all the furor surrounding  throughout — and particularly at the end — of 2017, one of the biggest concerns for those looking to buy cryptocurrency is whether they’ll retain their value. The short answer to that is nobody knows. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile and can rise and crash tens of percentage points in a single day, but some are proven more than others and may provide more stable investments for the future. Debuting in 2011, Litecoin is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, so it has one of the best records for retaining or increasing in value. It also has strong name recognition, which with many hundreds of alternative cryptocurrencies out there, is a critical facet in and of itself. Many exchanges now support Litecoin, which makes buying and selling it more comfortable and help it store value long-term. Ethereum is not as old as Litecoin — it only came into existence in 2015 — but it’s quickly garnered interest for its potential uses beyond cryptocurrencies, which we’ll address in more detail later in this guide. That interest has increased Ethereum’s name recognition. It’s separate enough from the “coin” terminology that it can strike out on its own a little easier, and it’s seeing growing support from exchanges. It’s still not common to see Ether used as a payment method, but that is steadily increasing too. Other factors worth considering in this debate are that Litecoin has a definitive 84 million token maximum, meaning that eventually, there will be no new Litecoin created. On the other hand, both altcoins will continue to be awarded for mining into the foreseeable future. The developers could cap the awards someday, but that has yet to happen. The scarcity brought about by a limitation on the number of tokens could mean that Litecoin ends up being a more valuable cryptocurrency in the future. For now, Ethereum seems likely to be the best store of value. It has a much higher and growing interest from the wider cryptocurrency community. Despite its younger age, its growing name recognition and availability should drive it forward, making it easier to purchase, access, and spend. Ethereum would most likely disappear if cryptocurrencies as a whole went kaput, but would otherwise be alright. The main reason cryptocurrencies came to exist, at least initially, was as a form of entirely decentralized digital money. That means using it to buy goods and services. As we’ve seen with Bitcoin, , especially if you aren’t willing to pay huge fees. So how do Litecoin and Ethereum compare in that respect? Considering Litecoin was created to be a better online transactional medium than Bitcoin, it’s no surprise that it’s pretty good at it. At the time of writing, its median transaction fee is just $0.0008 with a  (minutes/seconds). Confirmations come pretty quick, around four times faster than Bitcoin. That makes Litecoin great for conducting transactions online, especially considering the  that accept it. Ethereum is equally viable, however. Although its average fees are much higher — its  — the Ethereum block time is under 14 seconds. You can expect your transfers to receive multiple confirmations in a minute or less. That’s why over the past year, we’re seen Ethereum become the most traded cryptocurrency in the world, with more than a million transactions taking place some days. In comparison, Litecoin handles just over 30,000 transactions a day, and while even Bitcoin handles 300,000 or so,  Ethereum is trading hands with incredible frequency at almost 1,000,000 daily. Both Litecoin and Ethereum have their strengths in transactions. While Litecoin is the cheaper of the two to spend online, owners appear to be more interested in using Ether for the time being. Its short block time is hard to beat. While Litecoin is a cryptocurrency through and through, Ethereum is a little smarter than that. Ethereum itself is more than the Ether token. It’s also a platform that can facilitate Ether transactions in its own right. These are called “smart contracts.” We go into more detail on smart contracts in our discussion of  but in short,  underpins a smart contact to engender trust. Instead of lawyers confirming a commitment has been adhered to, the blockchain does it automatically. The contracts can tell when goods or services have been transferred, and Ether payments are then automatically sent. It’s a pie in the sky idea, but smart contracts could theoretically eliminate all sorts of intermediaries. For example, the use of smart contracts that send funds when milestones are reached would make crowdfunding services redundant. Likewise, real estate sellers could send purchase funds to financial institutions once the new owners have completed their end of the bargain. Litecoin has no such goals, and that’s fine, but it does mean it’s decidedly less functional than its younger sibling. Ethereum is the natural evolution of the decentralizing idea of cryptocurrencies that began with Bitcoin. Litecoin is more of an iteration on that initial idea. As with all cryptocurrency head-to-heads, naming one a champion over the other is hard. There are no guarantees in any of them, and one could crash and burn tomorrow while another soars in value. That said, we do have our favorites, and as it stands, Ethereum is the more functional, the more versatile, and the more technically impressive of these two cryptocurrencies.",

    "detailContent": "   Their age is the most obvious, with Bitcoin having entered this world as the very first global cryptocurrency in 2009 and Ethereum only showing up in 2015 as a potential alternative. Although it is less proven than its predecessor,  that give it a lot more potential than its older sibling in some key areas. For this guide, we’ll look at two shared aspects of the cryptocurrencies: Their ability to act as a store of value and as transactional mediums. We’ll also take a look at some of the unique features which make them stand apart. If you want a more general look at cryptocurrencies, or the ,  and  of some of our other guides. The most successful cryptocurrency for storing value continues to be Bitcoin. As the most valuable coin in the world by quite some margin — and the progenitor of the entire cryptocurrency revolution — Bitcoin has proven itself. It enjoys far more recognition than any of its peers, and that makes it easier to buy, store, and sell. That’s not to say that Ethereum and its coin, Ether, have been ineffective. For such a young currency, Ethereum has proved to be one of the most popular. At the time of writing, its market value and 24-hour trading volume are second only to Bitcoin. However, the actual monetary value for a single ETH is currently less than 3% of Bitcoin, so owning a few Ether is no way near as pleasant as holding a few Bitcoin. Part of that is down to Bitcoins’ built-in scarcity. There is a hard limit on the eventual number of Bitcoins, with diminishing returns for miners as they approach that mythical 21 million mark. One day no more Bitcoins will be created, and no matter , no more will be made. Thanks to supply and demand, Bitcoin should, in theory, grow in value, at least until no more coins appear. In comparison, Ethereum will continue to release the same amount of Ether regularly forever, so its supply will remain constant and expanding. Cryptocurrencies are nothing if not volatile, though. As much as it seems most likely that Bitcoin will remain the king of the cryptocurrencies for the foreseeable future, there is no guarantee of that. Although Bitcoin is better at storing value than Ethereum, at least for now, Ether has quickly become a preferred method for transferring wealth to and from people and entities. In the middle of 2017, it overtook Bitcoin in the number of daily transactions, and that shows no sign of stopping, with  the number of transactions taking place with Ether every day at the time of writing. The difference in speed is because Ethereum can serve as a platform for other cryptocurrencies, and also because Ether transactions tend to be confirmed quicker by the blockchain. It’s built to be more efficient than Bitcoin, partly through virtue of being a newer and more optimized cryptocurrency. The specifics of it are rather complicated, but if you want to dig into them,  will let you dive as deep as you want to go. Another advantage of using Ethereum over Bitcoin for transactions is that its fees tend to be far lower. There is always the potential that Ethereum will face increased charges as it hits the same sort of scaling walls as other cryptocurrencies. However, that is unlikely to happen in the same manner as it has Bitcoin, so costs will likely remain lower for some time to come. While the primary uses of Ethereum and Ether make it quite different from Bitcoin, the most significant arguable difference is in the underlying technology behind each and what that means for other cryptocurrencies. Technically, Ethereum isn’t a cryptocurrency at all, but a special kind of blockchain technology. This technology not only powers Ether transfers between people but can be used to create all types of other cryptocurrencies — and it has. Part of the reason there are so many cryptocurrencies today is that many of them are built on Ethereum’s underlying technology, even relying on it entirely in some cases. While  are beyond the scope of this guide, it’s all possible because of one key feature that Ethereum has that Bitcoin doesn’t — smart contracts. Where Bitcoin supports quite simple scripting (comparatively),  thanks to its smart contract system. It makes it possible to set simple rules that have to be followed, effectively forcing contractual compliance in a manner that would never be possible with a real-world contract, without some sort of middleman. An example of how that would work is that it could effectively emulate a crowd-funding website, only releasing a collection of Ether when a threshold is reached — no Kickstarter company required. Ethereum operates in a manner that is far more decentralizing than Bitcoin, even if its monetary impact on the world has yet to reach the heady heights of its bigger and older crypto-brother. Although you will easily find people willing to definitively tell you that one cryptocurrency (even outside of the Ethereum versus Bitcoin debate) is better than the other, that would do a disservice to whichever the loser is. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their advantages, and like most other cryptocurrencies, which one is right for you is very much dependent on your financial situation and what you want out of your investment. If you want to buy into the most proven cryptocurrency with the most developer support, Bitcoin is the better of the two currencies. It’s the most expensive out there, though, and its transaction fees are high, so if you want a significant return on what you’re putting into it, you’ll need to have plenty to spend and be patient. Bitcoin has repeatedly swung upward and downward in value in recent weeks, and its historic crashes can be devastating for those with big money invested. But as the die-hard fans often say, just “” If you plan to make more regular transactions, to pay for goods or services, or to send cryptocurrency to a loved one, Ethereum is much more manageable. With less of a scaling problem, its blockchain is far more open, and you’ll see your currency confirmed far faster. You’ll be charged much less for the privilege too. It’s not perfect, but it’s far better than Bitcoin in that respect. As with all of our coverage of cryptocurrency here on Digital Trends, though, this should not be considered financial advice. If you plan to put money into Bitcoin or Ethereum, do your research first. Digital currency is still a young venture, and the future of any of them is far from certain.",

    "detailContent": "   Bitcoin’s white paper was originally released in 2008, with the first Bitcoin being mined in 2009. Today you can buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin on a variety of different exchanges and with millions of individuals privately, all over the world.  released the white paper for its Libra cryptocurrency in 2019 but has yet to release the currency itself or the network to back it. It has projected that Libra will become available in 2020, though it has received substantial pushback from lawmakers and organizations. Perhaps the starkest difference between Bitcoin and Libra is where you can use the two cryptocurrencies. At this point in time, Libra hasn’t been officially released, so it’s not able to be used at all. When it is released, though, perhaps in 2020, it will be a digital currency that can be used for purchases and trades on Facebook, WhatsApp, and other  properties. Other supporting websites will potentially come on board at that time, most likely members of the Libra Association, but that’s yet to be confirmed. Bitcoin, on the other hand, can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world, entirely independent of any organization or platform. If two people have , they can send the cryptocurrency to one another with impunity, as long as someone is there to validate the transaction .  Trades can happen on exchanges, through direct trade websites, or even in large quantities with entire wallets in a practice that’s typically known as over the counter. Where Facebook will ultimately control where and how Libra is used, Bitcoin is almost entirely deregulated. That’s what makes it useful for ransomware blackmail and buying drugs on the dark web, among a myriad of more legitimate uses. Facebook was the sole developer of Libra for more than a year but following the cryptocurrency’s announcement,  opened up the underlying technology behind it, the Libra Blockchain, to the world, making it entirely open source. You can have a .  claims that it hopes many developers will expand Libra’s capabilities over the coming years. Bitcoin’s development wasn’t entirely dissimilar. It was first developed by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, before being handed off to the Bitcoin Foundation. Its code is open source also, with any number of independent developers working on it at any time, helping to work on its issues with scalability, security, and privacy. While these are relatively similar paths to this point, Facebook will continue to develop Libra and since it controls the major platforms that it’s used on, we would expect it to have a major say in how any Libra enhancements are utilized on them. As a driving member of the group that will manage Libra’s further development, too (see below), it seems likely that it will have a greater say in how it evolves than any one organization has with Bitcoin. A core tenet of Bitcoin from its inception has been that it is decentralized. No one organization or individual can change Bitcoin transactions, nor can they alter wallets or block anyone from using it. That’s because the , with thousands of nodes spread all over the world helping to validate transactions. There is no prerequisite to become a node, save for having the PC hardware required to store the blockchain and a network connection to update it. To alter the Bitcoin blockchain you would need to control more than 51% of all the computing power on the blockchain. Considering entire  exist all over the world, you’d need billions of dollars worth of computing equipment to even try. Libra is far more centralized. While it isn’t quite as controlled as something like , Libra will be managed by the , a collection of companies from a variety of industries, who will all have a say in its ongoing development and operation. They’ve paid $10 million apiece to be there and Facebook has said that they’ll all get a vote in matters pertaining to Libra’s evolution. It plans to have 100 members by the end of the year. Those members can also run nodes if they wish, though to start with Facebook is expected to run the majority of them. That means that with a simple vote, the members of the association could block trades, rewrite the blockchain, or even stop it temporarily if they gained a majority within the Association. That’s great for helping to block criminal activity on the Libra network and could help return any stolen Libra to the original owner, but it gives Facebook and the Association far greater powers over the cryptocurrency than anything any Bitcoin node can have. The original plan with Libra was to use a basket of various global fiat currencies to act as backing for Libra’s value, thereby stabilizing it and preventing volatile swings in value. It’s not clear if that’s still the plan, though, as , Facebook is also considering backing Libra with individual stable coins which are in turn tied to the real-world value of individual currencies like the British pound and the U.S. dollar. In comparison, there is nothing backing Bitcoin other than what people are willing to pay for it. That’s why it can experience such huge swings in the value, and why the next halving event in 2020 could cause such disruption as miners temporarily hold on to their Bitcoin rather than selling, to help inflate the value to make the process profitable again. As much as some might tout Bitcoin as a private, anonymous cryptocurrency, it isn’t. It’s semi-anonymous, with no way to prove someone owns an unaffiliated account or wallet, but transactions can be tracked on the very public blockchain. That’s why those seeking extra privacy and anonymity use tumblers to further obfuscate their activity. Altcoins like Monero offer much more robust security for the privacy-conscious. Libra, however, is an unknown in this field. Facebook has said that it will have its subsidiary, Calibra manage Libra for  users and it’s suggested that Calibra won’t share any user information. There will be a  function with Libra though, which does raise some privacy concerns. Some have raised concerns over Facebook’s repeated privacy gaffs over the years and its often , too. There are concerns that  could leverage Libra purchases and transactions to further its revenue from selling personal data of users, or to make advertisements even more targeted. While Bitcoin might not be perfect in its privacy protections, its lack of a singular point of oversight does make it far easier to trust for many. . Companies and governments could make the in- and off-ramps for Bitcoin investment and divestment difficult, but as long as nodes exist somewhere in the world, Bitcoin can be transacted. It could be traded for cash, for goods, services, and all manner of commodities that aren’t held by centralized banking organizations. It would be practically impossible to stop Bitcoin from being used entirely or to even regulate it effectively. Libra, on the other hand, caused a  and its white paper revealed. Although no regulations have yet been placed on it, governments are already keen to investigate it and have warned they may regulate it in the future. There may also be attempts at taxation, if possible. Since Libra is a relatively centralized cryptocurrency, it’s perfectly viable to regulate in these manners. While it would still be a technological hurdle, governments can throw their weight against Facebook if they don’t like what’s happening. Not so with Bitcoin.",

    "detailContent": " Would you accept cryptocurrency as a reward for watching ads? How about if you had to prove you had watched said ads by having your brain waves analyzed? It might sound a bit crazy, but it’s an idea Microsoft lays out in a new patent application titled “Cryptocurrency System Using Body Activity Data.” Filed in September 2018, but only  (USPTO) and , the application describes a method of how “brain wave or body heat emitted from the user when the user performs the task provided by an information service provider, such as viewing an advertisement or using certain internet services, can be used in the mining process.” As is described by the patent application, instead of the massive computation work that is required by “,” Microsoft’s hypothesis is that data generated based on the body activity of users can help “solve the computationally difficult problem unconsciously.” Other than brain waves and body heat, the system could also potentially monitor “body fluid flow” and “organ activity and movement.” All of this would, of course, require biometric reading of users, potentially via attached sensors. As a reward for wearing these, however, the system would then pay out cryptocurrency for completing certain tasks. As the application notes: “The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.” In addition to watching ads for a set amount of time, the patent application also notes how it could track tasks such as social media, using search engines, sending and receiving email, visiting websites, or using chatbots. Overall, it leaves a whole lot more questions open than it poses answers. Which cryptocurrency? Would the mining of these currencies be the main benefit for Microsoft or would it be the ability to prompt users to use certain services? And, most crucially of all, will this ever transition from a proof-of-concept to a fully fledged product? As with many patents, there’s a good chance that this is a defensive patent that will never actually be turned into a user-facing product. Nonetheless, it’s another reminder that tech giants are always looking for new ways to keep eyes (and brain waves, organ activity, etc.) on their products.",

    "title": "What Is Bitcoin Mining? Here\u0027s Everything You Need to Know | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Bitcoin mining is far removed from the average Bitcoin owner these days, but that doesn’t change how important it is. It’s the process that helps the cryptocurrency function as intended and what continues to introduce new Bitcoins to digital wallets all over the world. Collecting cryptocurrency can be boiled down to a simple premise: “Miners,” as they are known, purchase powerful computing chips designed for the process and use them to run specifically crafted software day and night. That software forces the system to complete complicated calculations — imagine them digging through layers of digital rock. If all goes to plan, the miners are rewarded with some Bitcoin at the end of their toils. Bitcoin works differently from traditional currencies. Where dollars, pounds, and euros, for instance, are handled by banks and financial institutions that collectively confirm when transactions occur, Bitcoin operates on the basis of a public ledger system. In order for transactions to be confirmed — to avoid the same Bitcoin from being spent twice, for example — a number of Bitcoin nodes, operated by miners around the world, need to give it their seal of approval. For that, they are rewarded the transaction fees paid by those conducting them, and while there are still new Bitcoins to be made — there are currently more than  — a separate reward too, in order to incentivize the practice. In taking part in mining, miners create new Bitcoins to add to the general circulation, while facilitating the very transactions that make Bitcoin a functional cryptocurrency. Mining is a risky process though. It not only takes heavy lifting from the mining chips themselves, but boatloads of electricity, powerful cooling, and a strong network connection. The reward at the end isn’t even guaranteed either, so it should never be entered into lightly. The reason it’s called mining isn’t that it involves a physical act of digging. Bitcoin are entirely digital tokens that don’t require explosive excavation or panning streams, but they do have their own form of prospecting and recovery, which is where the “mining” nomenclature comes from. Prospective miners download and run bespoke mining software — of which there are  — and often join a pool of other miners doing the same thing. Together or alone, the software compiles recent Bitcoin transactions into blocks and proves their validity by calculating a  which covers all of the data in those blocks. That involves the mining hardware taking a huge number of guesses at a particular integer over and over until they find the correct one. It’s a computationally intense process that is further hampered by deliberate increases in difficulty as more and more miners attempt to create the next block in the chain. That’s why people join pools and why only the most powerful of application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining hardware is effective at mining Bitcoins today. The individual miner or pool that is the first to create the proof of work for a block is rewarded with transaction fees for those confirmed transactions and a subsidy of Bitcoin. That subsidy is made up of new Bitcoin, which are generated through the process of mining. That will continue to happen until all 21 million have been mined. There is no guarantee that any one miner or mining pool will generate the correct integer needed to confirm a block and thereby earn the reward. That’s precisely why miners join pools. Although their reward is far smaller should they mine the next block since it’s shared among all members of the pool, the chances of earning such a reward are far greater as a collective and a return on any investment much more likely. Bitcoin was originally designed to allow anyone to take part in the mining process with a home computer and thereby enjoy the process of mining themselves, receiving a reward on occasion for their service. ASIC miners have made that impossible for anyone unable to invest thousands of dollars and use cheap and plentiful electricity. That’s why  has become so popular, recently entering the news cycle as a Nintendo Switch title,  was rumored to include secret cryptocurrency mining software written into the code. Although hardware has pushed many miners out of the practice though, there are safeguards in place that prevent all remaining Bitcoins from being mined in a short period of time. The first of those is a (likely)  in the mining calculations that must be made. Every 2,016 blocks — at a rate of six blocks an hour, roughly every two weeks — the mining difficulty is recalculated. Mostly it increases as more miners and mining hardware join the network, but if the overall mining power were to reduce, then the difficulty would decrease to maintain a roughly 10-minute block-generation time. The purpose of that relatively hard 10-minute time is because that way the number of Bitcoins being generated by the process will be slow and steady, and thereby mostly controlled. This is compounded by the reduction in reward for blocks mined every 210,000 blocks. Each time that threshold is reached, the reward is halved. In early 2020, mining a block rewards 12.5 Bitcoins, which is worth around $80,000. In the future, as mining rewards decrease, the transaction rewarded to miners will make up a larger percentage of miner income. At the rate with which  difficulty is increasing, mining hardware development is progressing, and rewards are decreasing, projections for the final Bitcoins being mined edge into the 22nd century.",

    "detailContent": " Imagine if every JPEG image file had blockchain-protected data that would verify — or refute — a photograph’s origins. The concept may be more than just an idea. The same organization that created the JPEG wants to use blockchain to flag fake news and fight image theft. The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is organizing workshops to gain feedback into the possibility of creating a standard blockchain that could both help viewers quickly identify a faked photo and help photographers fight image theft. , Australia, the committee began exploring the possibility of creating a new JPEG compression that uses artificial intelligence. Blockchain uses multiple computers to save data to store information that can’t be altered. Most commonly associated with cryptocurrency, this isn’t the first time that saving data to multiple locations in an unalterable way has been suggested as an option to help photographers fight image theft.  is a system that uses web crawlers to spot image theft and license images, but the system is limited to payments in KodakCoin. But, what JPEG wants to do is create a standardized system that uses encryption, hash signatures, watermarking or a combination inside a photograph’s metadata. The JPEG format is widely used, building a standardized system, in the same way, could create a widely-used system that anyone could access without signing up for a program. By creating a standard, any application could use the metadata built into the photo to protect images — perhaps, with such a standard, social media networks could even analyze the image’s metadata and recognize faked photos at upload. The key word, though, is “could” — currently, the committee is just in the discussion phases and is speaking with industry leaders to determine what such a system could be used for and what should be part of the standardization. The group has stated, however, that they’ve identified “great potential” in the technology. The group has been running workshops on the topic since 2018, but held an open discussion at their latest meeting. Besides identifying fake news and flagging copyright violations, JPEG suggests that such a system could be used for media forensics, along with applications in privacy and security. The latest discussion also suggested the possibility of using the technology for smart contracts. During the meeting in Sydney, the group also explored creating . The organization is now asking for research to illustrate whether or not A.I. can do a better job at image compression, maintaining details while lowering file size. “The efforts to find new and improved solutions in image compression have led JPEG to explore new opportunities relying on machine learning for coding,” professor Touradj Ebrahimi, the convenor of the JPEG Committee, said in a statement. “After rigorous analysis in form of explorations during the last 12 months, JPEG believes that it is time to formally initiate a standardization process, and consequently, has issued a call for evidence for image compression based on machine learning.”",

    "detailContent": " Yet another company that signed on as a partner in Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency known as Libra has backed out of the association. The British telecommunications operator Vodafone announced its departure from Facebook’s Libra Association on Tuesday, . In total, eight companies have now backed out of the Libra partnership. “We can confirm that Vodafone is no longer a member of the Libra Association. Although the makeup of the Association members may change over time, the design of Libra’s governance and technology ensures the Libra payment system will remain resilient,” the Libra Association said in a statement. “The Association is continuing the work to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of the Libra payment system.” Vodafone operates in 26 countries and offers mobile, broadband, and TV services, as well as cloud and security products. It joins other companies like PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, Stripe, and Argentine e-commerce giant Mercado Pago that had already pulled out of the project.

They’re “privacy-preserving,” the company claims, from brands you know well like Pizza Hut, Home Chef, and Intel. In addition to Brave Ads, the latest Brave browser automatically blocks third-party ads and trackers.

    "detailContent": " The first baby to have their birth certificate officially recorded  has been registered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Carried out using IBM’s Blockchain Platform, the blockchain birth certificate offers a glimpse at the way that the cryptographic record-keeping technology is creeping into every aspect of our lives. Right down to recording the existence of new beings (like baby Álvaro de Medeiros Mendonça) as they arrive on planet Earth. “The birth certificate is a foundational identity document of which trust is established for downstream derived identity documents such as a [driver’s license],” , chief technology officer for Trusted Identity at IBM, told Digital Trends. “This first of its kind [demonstration means] the establishment of an immutable audit trail of transactions from approvers that leads to a government attestation about an individual’s identity and reputation. Just like in the physical card domain, the issuance of a digital birth record is a stepping stone to bootstrapping a broader digital credential marketplace.” Got that? Amid the marketing speak, this means that blockchain is increasingly being looked as a technology that will be used to record all kinds of official records. Buying a house? Record it on the blockchain. Getting married? What could be more of a demonstration of you and your partner’s unending love for one another than immortalizing it on a distributed, decentralized, public ledger? “The birth registry is aimed at reducing registration processing time, improving the experience of all workflow stakeholders and increasing trust in the registration system,” Gisolfi continued. “The current workflow is extremely manual and plagued by the potential of human errors during the process. This [is a pioneering] effort to digitize a foundational identity document for all governments to learn from. This effort is exciting because it demonstrates the importance of trust at both the data and identity levels.” The birth was registered on July 8, although news has only been shared now. Unlike previous ways of registering births, which could take several hours to complete, this new approach can reportedly generate a “fully valid certificate in no more than 15 minutes.” Now if only someone could come up with a way to make those other more physical parts of childbirth a little bit easier!",

    "detailContent": " HTC has just announced a new, more affordable version of its  smartphone — a device that comes with a built-in hardware wallet for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The new HTC Exodus 1s costs 219 euros (around $244) and allows owners to buy, sell, send, receive, lend, and borrow cryptocurrency directly from the device. The HTC Exodus 1s also boasts software tools that enable it to run a full Bitcoin node. This functionality is built atop a basic, budget Android phone. “We are providing the tools for access to universal basic finance; the tools to have a metaphorical Swiss bank in your pocket,” Phil Chen, decentralized chief officer at HTC said in a press release. “Full nodes are the most important ingredient in the resilience of the Bitcoin network and we have lowered the barrier to entry for any person to run a node, which is simply a computer, mobile in our case, participating in the global Bitcoin network that propagates transactions and blocks everywhere, which is the foundation and fundamental definition of a peer-to-peer cash system.” If you’re wondering what all this means, we interviewed Chen last year and he explained  and why you might want one. Right now, this is only likely to pique the interest of people trading in cryptocurrency or gaming collectibles, but by offering a much more affordable device, HTC is hoping to tempt more people who are curious to dip a toe in the water. The original HTC Exodus 1 could only be purchased with cryptocurrency on release and at relatively high prices to begin with, close to $1,000, though it was later sold more conventionally for $699. The HTC Exodus 1s is much more affordable at 219 Euros, which is around $244 at the time of writing. Even the  cut corners, so it won’t be a shock to find that the HTC Exodus 1s has modest specs. We’re talking about a phone that runs  8.1 Oreo, with a separate secure enclave that handles all your crypto transactions. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 inside with 4GB of , 64GB of storage and room for a MicroSD card, which is just as well because the full Bitcoin ledger is 260GB right now and growing at 60GB per year. If you wanted to, you could put it on a MicroSD card and you’d be able to verify and relay transactions directly from the Exodus 1 without having to connect to a centralized third-party. You’ll also find a 5.7-inch display, 13-megapixel cameras front and back, and a 3,000mAh battery in the new phone. The HTC Exodus 1s made its debut appearance at the Lightning Conference in Berlin, where it is on sale immediately using the Lightning payment network. You can also order it at the , but this initial launch is only for Europe, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. More territories, possibly including the U.S. will follow at a later date.",

On Tuesday this week, it was reported that Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal were all  in Facebook’s scheme following regulatory scrutiny from lawmakers in both the U.S. and Europe. Yesterday, PayPal put a first nail in Libra’s coffin by announcing it would no longer be participating in the Libra Association. “PayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations,” PayPal said in a statement to . “We remain supportive of Libra’s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future.  has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal, and we will continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities.” The concept of the Libra Association is a regulatory body composed of representatives from top technology companies like Spotify and Uber as well as financial players like credit card companies. The association’s inaugural meeting is set for October 14 in Geneva, intended to be the venue to establish how companies will contribute to the cryptocurrency project. However, it’s looking increasingly doubtful that the project will get off the ground, as experts and lawmakers have been raising alarms about the plan. There are worries that the currency could be used in money laundering operations, and also that Facebook is trying to get around national and international financial regulations.

In a Senate Banking Committee hearing about the concept in July, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) described ’s plan as “delusional.” None of this seems to be putting off Libra loyalists, however. A statement put out by a Libra spokesperson slammed PayPal for its “lack of commitment” and suggested it lacked the “boldness and fortitude” to join the endeavor.

    "title": "Researchers Want to Rethink Cryptocurrency to Make It More Sustainable | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Bitcoin is undoubtedly exciting, but, as much as it might promise to solve some of the problems associated with global finance, it’s also responsible for creating problems of its own. The most concerning of these is the  due to the huge amounts of electricity it requires. This, in turn, results in tens of millions of metric tons worth of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere. That’s a big cause for concern, and it’s something that researchers at Switzerland’s Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne have been . In contrast to the large electricity consumption and carbon footprint of Bitcoin, they are developing a new approach to cryptocurrencies they hope could lead to a near zero-energy alternative. “We developed an algorithm that enables payment in a secure and efficient manner,” , a professor in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences, told Digital Trends. “Essentially, unlike Bitcoin and its alternatives, the algorithm we propose does not require reaching global agreement about the ordering of all transactions.” But how does it do this? The answer involves a fundamental rethink of the traditional Bitcoin model, first described more than a decade ago by mysterious Bitcoin pioneer Satoshi Nakamoto. That approach involves a “consensus” distributed system in which all players must agree on the validity of transactions, which involves the execution of complex and energy-intensive computing tasks. The alternative approach, called the Byzantine Reliable Broadcast, works by assuming participants in the system are good actors and only ignoring them if they are seen to be abusing it. In doing so, the researchers behind the project think safe cryptocurrency transactions could be achieved with just a few grams of CO2 rather than an estimated 300 kg for a current single Bitcoin transaction. That’s more like sending or receiving an email. “The problem we are solving is called double payment, and it is the main problem posed by Nakamoto in ‘his’ ,” Rachid explained. “We basically looked carefully at the problem and realized that you do not need a heavy consensus-based solution. If, hypothetically, Alice wants to send money to Bob, it is enough for Bob to ask around if Alice was not trying to cheat and give the same money to somebody else.” The work was selected as the best paper at the International Conference of Distributed Computing (DISC). There’s still a long way before this work ever gets turned into an actual cryptocurrency approach, however — if, indeed, it ever does. “I’m not sure whether I’d do that,” Rachid continued. “I would rather open-source it and have people use the algorithm for exchanging goods in a frugal manner.”",

    "title": "How the World Food Programme Uses Iris Scanning and Blockchain | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  If you could purchase groceries not with cash or card, but simply by letting the cashier scan your eye, would you do it? Given the numerous privacy scandals involving tech companies recently, more than a few of us might be wary of biometrics. For refugees in Jordan, however, a combination of iris scanning and  – dubbed Building Blocks — is the latest innovation that the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has deployed to make putting food on the table easier. Since 2011, more than 6.6 million Syrians have fled political violence in their country, and while there has been a lot of media attention paid to those coming (or trying to come) to Europe, many have sought refuge in neighboring countries. Jordan alone houses 755,000 refugees (the vast majority from Syria), according to a 2019 report from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with 16 percent living in refugee camps. For the WFP, the world’s largest humanitarian organization dedicated to eliminating hunger, getting food to refugees who need it requires detailed planning. “Traditionally, the way we’ve assisted people is by bringing food in kind and distributing it, like food, rice, corn, all of that,” says Houman Haddad, head of Emerging Technologies for the WFP. “So, we’ve essentially been a logistics company.” Shipping and distributing vast quantities of food can be expensive, and as refugee numbers surge in response to crises, so do the logistical problems. “At the start of the Syria crisis, we had hundreds of Syrians fleeing conflict from Syria through Jordan’s border,” Shada Moghraby, WFP communications officer, explains. “And we started out distributing ready meals that consisted of a bowl of rice, a protein, and a vegetable, and some milk or drink, through contracts with local restaurants.” As more refugees flowed over the border, the WFP shifted to food boxes containing basic items like pasta and lentils. The organization knew that even this was unsustainable in the long run, however. That’s why the WFP has been experimenting with “cash-based transfers,” directing money to refugees so they can spend it on food themselves. This has a number of benefits. Aside from cutting down on the costs of physically moving food, empowering refugees to buy their own food injects money into the economies hosting them. “Instead of us bringing corn from another side of the world and killing the smallholder farmers locally, we stimulate the local economy,” Haddad says, adding that cash-based transfers are more dignified for the people receiving them. “Instead of us telling people, ‘Eat corn!’ they can choose what they want.” To facilitate these cash transfers, WFP set up contracts with local banks to provide refugees with electronic smart cards. “Then, every month, we upload a specific amount of money onto that smart card,” Moghraby explains, “and they can go to WFP-contracted supermarkets to spend whatever amount they get from the World Food Programme to buy products such as vegetables, fruit, eggs, and even meat and poultry, so that they can have a full, nutritious meal.” Cards and vouchers aren’t without flaws, however. A card can be lost or stolen, in which case it could take days, even a week to replace. As such, WFP deployed a new, more convenient system: Iris scanners in the checkout line. When refugees shop at a “WFP-contracted supermarket,” Moghraby said, “instead of having a card on them or any ID paper, they’ll just get their groceries, go to a cashier” and look into an iris scanner. “It communicates with a database that has all the details of the beneficiary, and it confirms that this person is a WFP beneficiary, and then that person can take their groceries and go home. The whole process takes about 3 seconds,” he added. Instead of having a card on them or any ID paper, they’ll just get their groceries, go to a cashier” and look into an iris scanner. The system has especially been a boon for women, who no longer need to worry about purse-snatchers, and can pop into a supermarket whenever they realize they need something. “We’ve been noticing that the program has made the women of the families more prominent,” Moghraby says. “They’re the ones who are handling the expenses on the food … traditionally in Syria, it was the men who used to do that.” People tend to be wary about their data these days — for good reason — and it’s particularly concerning for vulnerable populations like refugees, especially those who may be targeted by the governments they’re fleeing. Recognizing that there might be privacy concerns, WFP started small, rolling the program out in small groups and soliciting feedback to make sure people were comfortable with the program. Although some refugees were concerned that their biometric data could end up in the hands of some government, both Haddad and Moghraby point out that WFP has no access to the database itself, which is maintained by the UNHCR. “Even though biometrics are sensitive — I can’t imagine anyone being super-thrilled about using them” “Even though biometrics are sensitive — I can’t imagine anyone being super-thrilled about using them — they are honestly necessary in this kind of context,” Haddad says. “A lot of refugees lack formal documentation. Some who have them will also destroy them on their journey. For example, Syrian refugees, because if they are caught by the wrong group on the journey based on their ethnicity or background, they could be killed at times.” The WFP needed a way to accurately keep track of people without the documentation governments typically look for, and they needed to keep the identities of individual refugees private. The solution? You guessed it: Blockchain, the decentralized, distributed ledger technology that is famous as the foundation for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Since WFP’s assistance is family-based, according to Haddad, each individual has a personal ID that is linked to a family ID. When a refugee uses an iris scanner, “that imprint goes end-to-end encrypted to UNHCR,” he adds. “We don’t see any of it. UNHCR then returns to us the family account number for the person who was there.” The system checks the transaction amount and the family’s current entitlement, and if the family has sufficient funds, WFP authorizes the transaction. All of this is carried out on the blockchain, which is decentralized to prevent tampering, and where every step of the process is verified. Most importantly for the users, their biometric data is safe from prying eyes. “Nobody other than UNHCR has access to the biometrics,” Haddad says. “We can use it to get the family ID, but we don’t see the biometric imprints. We don’t have the biometric data and we certainly don’t have the names and dates of birth of people associated with that.” The beauty of the blockchain isn’t limited to WFP, however. For Haddad, it is the foundation for a better, more collaborative U.N. Refugees don’t just need food. They also need medicine, education, and more, each provided by different agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or UNICEF. Now that many of these organizations are offering cash-based assistance, the need for coordination has spiked, according to Haddad, and that can be difficult given that various organizations, who may be serving the same populations, develop their own distinct systems. “Each organization usually develops their system for their needs and then if you make it too broad, it becomes bloated,” he explains. “The idea here is to use blockchain as a neutral space, so organizations can use the systems they are comfortable with and have developed over the years to manage the relationship with the people they serve, to determine the entitlements that each person should get.” Since no individual party controls the information on the blockchain, every organization involved can feel secure in using it. Technological advances in providing aid are going to be more important than ever. According to the UNHCR, there are more than 25 million refugees around the world in 2019, the highest number ever. The World Bank , climate change could press 143 million people out of their homes.",

    "title": "HTC Exodus Blockchain-Powered Phone: Here\u0027s Everything We Know | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Nowadays, it seems tough to escape  — especially with the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As part of what HTC claims is its “effort to expand the blockchain ecosystem,” the company introduced its latest blockchain phone known as the . The phone has released but, strangely, details on the HTC Exodus 1 are still hard to come by. DT can fix that. Here’s everything you need to know about HTC’s blockchain-powered phone.  HTC and Bitcoin.com have announced a partnership that will see the Exodus 1 get a new crypto wallet for Bitcoin Cash without the need to download a wallet separately. New Exodus 1 phones will be sold with the wallet out-of-the-box while existing devices will get an update with the new feature. Bitcoin.com and HTC plan on continuing their partnership too. Notably, according to HTC, future plans include special discounts for customers paying for phones in Bitcoin Cash, the sale of Exodus smartphones on Bitcoin.com, and more. HTC may not have shown off an awful lot at MWC 2019, but it did reveal some over-the-air updates hitting the HTC Exodus. Key to these updates is a new partnership with Opera Mobile, which promises to strip away data-mining middlemen by increasing the level of privacy and security offered through mobile browsing. It uses a transparent peer-to-peer service to achieve this, something HTC refers to as the “decentralized web.” This new Opera partnership also has some interactions with the HTC Exodus’s Zion wallet, and users will be able to use the wallet to make micropayments to certain content websites, putting more funding control in the hands of content readers. While full details about the design of the HTC Exodus are a little vague right now, HTC has released some images that give us a basic idea of what the phone will look like. Despite the technology under the hood, the phone doesn’t look all that different from other smartphones on the market. It’s got a dual-sensor camera on the back with a fingerprint sensor about a third of the way down. No word yet on the design on the front — or if it’ll feature a notch or headphone jack. The device features a 6-inch HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, along with a 16-megapixel and 12-megapixel dual rear-facing camera and two 8-megapixel front-facing cameras. Under the hood, the device boasts a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, coupled with 6GB of , 128GB of storage, and a 3,500mAh battery. You’ll find  8.0 Oreo running the system, and the phone is fully IP68-rated for water-resistance. There are a few advantages to the phone over others. For starters, HTC has developed a cryptocurrency wallet called Zion, which allows you to store cryptocurrency on the phone itself. That’s all stored in the secure enclave — a part of the system that’s kept separate from Android, and uses SoftBank’s Arm Holdings to keep everything safe. That’s also where you can store keys to your cryptocurrency and tokens like CryptoKitties. As part of the HTC Exodus, HTC has also built a social key recovery system. Basically, you can keep recovery details about your phone with a trusted friend, after which they’ll have to download a key management app. Then, HTC will use a sharing algorithm to send information to your friends, which can then be pieced together if need be. Initially, it will launch with support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dfinity networks, and Lightning Network, but the company says it will eventually support the entire blockchain ecosystem. HTC plans on creating a native blockchain network with all Exodus phones, in an effort to double and triple the number of nodes of Ethereum and Bitcoin. The device will also feature what’s supposed to be a trusted and user-friendly UI for DApps. By bringing DApps to mobile, HTC hopes to streamline the mobile user experience throughout the DApp community as a whole. Want to get the HTC Exodus for yourself? The device is now up for sale from the . The phone will sell for 0.15 BTC, or 4.78 ETH, which equates to around $960 at the time of this writing, and there are  purchasing options too. It was originally the case that you needed cryptocurrency to purchase the phone — but HTC has just removed that requirement. You’ll now be able to buy the HTC Exodus in “Fiat” or real currency too. It’ll set you back $699. The phone is available in a hefty 34 countries, including the U.S., parts of Europe, New Zealand, the U.K., Taiwan, and more. Of note, the phone will not be available in China — largely because the country bans cryptocurrency trading. ",

    "title": "Facebook Might Delay or Cancel Libra Cryptocurrency Launch | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Facebook’s drive to create its own worldwide cryptocurrency might have hit a brick wall. The company said that  planned 2020 launch might be delayed – or it might not ever happen at all. In ,  warned investors that “market acceptance of such currency is subject to significant uncertainty.” “As such, there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all,” the company wrote in the section of the report discussing risk factors. “We do not have significant prior experience with digital currency or blockchain technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services.” Facebook sees Libra as a currency of the future that’s designed to allow payments to happen across the internet and around the world. It’s specifically aimed at the 1.7 billion people globally who don’t have a bank account. We reached out to  to see if that vision has changed. Company spokesman Joshua Gunter would not say whether or not Libra’s launch would be delayed past 2020, but said  would “not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.” “We know that the journey to launching Libra will be a long one and that we cannot do this alone. Engaging with regulators, policymakers, and experts is critical to Libra’s success. This was the whole reason that Facebook, along with other members of the Libra Association, shared our plans early,” Gunter told Digital Trends in a statement. “The time between now and launch is designed to be an open, collaborative process,” he added. Libra has major backing, including support from Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, but almost immediately drew skepticism from regulators and elected officials in the U.S. and around the world. During a , politicians of both parties told Calibra head David Marcus to slow down the plans for a 2020 launch. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) called Facebook “delusional” for wanting to create a currency, and Sen. Martha McSally (R-Arizona) told Marcus that she didn’t trust . Even President Donald Trump , claiming it will have “little standing or dependability.” At the same time, in India – where Libra sees a lucrative market of more than a billion people – the . Facebook seems to be aware that governments around the world aren’t fans of the Libra plans – and said as much in the SEC filing. “Libra is based on relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding digital currency are uncertain and evolving,” Facebook wrote. “Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue.” “As a primary sponsor of the initiative, we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators, and adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business,” the company added.",

    "detailContent": " If you’ve been trading Bitcoin and haven’t been reporting your earnings to the IRS, you might be getting a surprise in your mailbox. The IRS is cracking down on cryptocurrency traders who didn’t report their earnings on their taxes. By the end of next month, around 10,000 people are expected to get letters from the IRS asking them to pay back taxes on unreported earnings from cryptocurrency trading, . Last year the IRS launched a “Virtual Currency Compliance campaign” to address noncompliance related to the use of virtual currency. “U.S. persons are subject to tax on worldwide income from all sources including transactions involving virtual currency. IRS Notice 2014-21 states that virtual currency is property for federal tax purposes and provides information on the U.S. federal tax implications of convertible virtual currency transactions,” . “The Virtual Currency Compliance campaign will address noncompliance related to the use of virtual currency through multiple treatment streams including outreach and examinations. The compliance activities will follow the general tax principles applicable to all transactions in property, as outlined in Notice 2014-21. The IRS will continue to consider and solicit taxpayer and practitioner feedback in education efforts, future guidance, and development of Practice Units. Taxpayers with unreported virtual currency transactions are urged to correct their returns as soon as practical. The IRS is not contemplating a voluntary disclosure program specifically to address tax non-compliance involving virtual currency.” Last week . The names of those who are receiving the letter were acquired from . “Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously by reviewing their tax filings and when appropriate, amend past returns and pay back taxes, interest, and penalties,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. “The IRS is expanding our efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics. We are focused on enforcing the law and helping taxpayers fully understand and meet their obligations.” Taxpayers that do not accurately report their earnings through cryptocurrency trading are liable for the tax for those earnings as well as penalties and interest. In some cases, the IRS notes that those who have not paid taxes on cryptocurrency earnings could potentially face criminal prosecution.",

    "title": "The Senate Hearing on Libra Did Not Go Well for Facebook | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency had its first big regulatory test on Tuesday when Calibra head David Marcus . It didn’t go well. One senator said  was “delusional” to want to create its own cryptocurrency. Senators from both parties were concerned about the risks of what would in theory be a widely used currency that could lack meaningful regulation. Their criticism ranged from issues with Facebook’s less-than-stellar reputation for how it treats user data to worries about how scammers could use Libra to bilk people out of their savings. “Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the committee. “We would be crazy to give them a chance to experiment with people’s bank accounts, and to use powerful tools they don’t understand, like monetary policy, to jeopardize hard-working Americans’ ability to provide for their families.” Marcus’  laid out a framework for how Libra would work under existing U.S. regulations, including how states could regulate digital wallet apps. Facebook envisions Libra as its own currency that will be headquartered in Switzerland but used worldwide through wallet apps. Facebook’s own app, Calibra, would presumably have a significant advantage over others since it would be built into properties it owns, includinfg , Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. But lax regulation in the market for digital wallets could push people – and their data – to unsavory wallet apps. “I don’t trust you guys,” said Sen. Martha McSally (R-Arizona), who was concerned that Facebook would share users’ payment data. “Instead of cleaning up your house, you are launching into a new business model.” Facebook has said that it would only share data on payments with third parties if a user consents, and Marcus said there would be a wall between Facebook’s social side and Libra’s finance side, adding that the company knows it has to “earn people’s trust for a very long period of time.” “The way we’ve built this is to separate social and financial data,” he said, “because we’ve heard loud and clear from people that they want those two data streams separate.” A Facebook spokesperson told Digital Trends that the company was happy with the hearing and that lawmakers raised thoughtful questions about issues that Libra’s founders would needed to work through when trying to innovate the financial sector. Marcus himself called the hearing “thoughtful” in a series of tweets on Tuesday afternoon. 2/3\nThe conversation was thoughtful and highlighted important issues we, and the  Founding Members, will need to address. I want to reiterate here what I said before the Committee: We will take the time to get this right. \u0026mdash; David Marcus (@davidmarcus)  3/3\nAnd we will not launch until we’ve fully addressed regulator concerns. We also recognize that for the Calibra wallet trust is essential. I’m looking forward to speaking with the  tomorrow. \u0026mdash; David Marcus (@davidmarcus)  Marcus is unlikely to face a friendlier audience on Wednesday when he appears before the House Banking Committee, where Democrats are considering a bill to ban big tech from the finance industry, . Both parties have become skeptical of Facebook – it’s one of the few issues Congress can agree on. The social media company is also , who recently attacked Libra. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  about Libra. The Federal Trade Commission also over Facebook’s treatment of private data during the Cambridge Analytica scandal. A Facebook spokesperson said that the company had no more news to share about its launch plans for Libra, which is slated to become available in 2020. In all, it’s looking increasingly likely that Libra might be delayed beyond its planned 2020 launch – if it even launches at all.",

    "title": "India\u0027s Proposed Ban on Facebook Libra Threatens New Cryptocurrency | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Just as the initial buzz around Facebook’s newly unveiled Libra cryptocurrency started to die down, it roared back to life this week with India’s announcement that it is considering  within its jurisdiction. If the prohibition were to go into effect, Libra would be kept out of the third-largest market in the world’s most populous continent, which would seriously imperil the fledgling digital currency. This adversarial stance by the Indian government also comes only days after the U.S  House of Representatives issued  so that possible regulatory measures could be devised, debated, and enacted. Considering the segment of consumers Libra targets, India’s proposed ban poses an especially dire threat. In the cryptocurrency’s debut last month,  noted that Libra was designed to allow  users without reliable access to bank accounts to . By giving so-called “unbanked” adults around the world a frictionless way to engage in online commerce, Facebook would ostensibly benefit from essentially dominating the market for such a solution. When weighed against Libra’s raison d’etre, India occupies the sweet spot between , , and a . In fact, India’s market makes for such a perfect fit for Libra that it is a near certainty that Facebook had the country in mind to drive phase one of the rollout. Without India, Libra’s hopes could be dashed before a single coin is traded. It might seem puzzling at first blush to see India taking such a hard line on Libra, but it makes more sense when viewed in the context of Facebook’s dubious history expanding in the developing world and India’s bid for global economic supremacy. As ’s uptake in the developed world has , the social network has been desperately trying to dig out a foothold in developing regions. These initiatives have usually been cloaked in the guise of altruism. Upon further inspection, they tend to be near exploitative beneath the surface. The most notable instance of this was Facebook’s developing world internet connectivity project, .org, which was found to only allow access to only a handful of websites with  (ostensibly to open user data to collection and mining). Any country would understandably be loath let a company that shows such contempt for users’ privacy and security do business within its borders. On top of that, , and allowing a foreign-controlled digital currency to set up shop in the country would be seriously at odds with those plans. Part of growing an economy to superpower proportions involves strengthening domestic banking institutions, particularly to the point where they extend more and more credit abroad. The last thing India, or any nation in a similar position, would want is to stifle the growth of its domestic banking sector. It’d be doing exactly that by opening it to competition with a banking alternative backed by such foreign payment processing heavyweights as Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal. Until India receives assurances from Facebook and the Libra Association that Libra won’t abuse its citizens’ digital privacy, and won’t harm its domestic banking interests (the latter guarantee being much harder to ensure than the former), India seems unlikely to budge on the its promised ban.",

    "detailContent": " As a decentralized cash alternative for payments and a form of investment, the popularity of cryptocurrency has surged over the years. It’s become so popular that Facebook , Libra, but that won’t be available until 2020. From playful collectors of CryptoKitties to zealots who create coins to align themselves with the views of , the cryptocurrency market has seen its fair share of both  and zany coins over the years. Here are the top five weirdest cryptocurrencies you can buy today: Though it started out in jest based on the popular Doge meme in 2013, the Dogecoin actually attracts a loyal following, thanks to its playful Japanese dog breed Shiba Inu mascot. Over the years, owners have used Dogecoin to pay for items ranging from the mundane to high-priced real estate. The currency reached its peak in January 2018 with a market cap of $2 billion, and the community has participated in a number of marketing moves, including sponsoring sports events like NASCAR, donating money to fund clean water in Kenya, and even running a crowdfunding campaign for its members. Dogecoin gained notoriety shortly after its creation when a hacker accessed the Dogewallet file system to route all coins to another static IP address. The community launched a fundraising initiative called SaveDogemas to help donate coins to those affected by the breach, and the effort was successfully completed in about a month’s time. Though it’s better known for its photography film, Kodak announced that it was entering the cryptocurrency market at CES in January 2018. KodakCoin, as it is known, was designed to work with the company’s KodakOne platform as a currency for payment for the licensing of photographs. KodakCoin’s initial coin offering was scheduled for January 31, 2018, but the company delayed the launch for July 1, 2019. As a way to attract photographers to Kodak’s platforms and help them monetize their art,  is based upon blockchain technology. The platform uses web crawlers to identify stolen images online and seek licensing fees. Photographers are intended to eventually collect in KodakCoin. Miners can also use the Kodak’s KashMiner to extract more coins. Based on the Ethereum platform,  was conceived as a way to pay your dentist for ongoing oral treatments. It’s marketed as an alternative blockchain-based payment method that dentists can accept while at the same time promoting patient health, but this cryptocurrency actually works more like a healthcare financing plan. Patients make monthly payments to a DentaCoin account, and in turn, the dentist gets a share of that fee for dental procedures. The goal, according to the company, is to make preventive dental care more affordable to people with no private dental insurance by securing payments and reducing transaction costs through the DentaCoin Wallet app. Though it’s primarily used as a payment method, DentaCoin can also help patients and dentists share medical records. Though it’s gimmicky, Whoppercoin, created by Burger King in Russia, is designed as a cryptocurrency for bartering, taking us back to the roots of the exchange of goods before money was invented. Whoppercoin was created as a loyalty program for the Russian house of Whoppers, and customers can get one Whoppercoin for each ruble spent in purchases. In sum, you would need to collect 1,700 Whoppercoins to get a free burger. For reference, one U.S. dollar is equivalent to 65 Russian rubles. If cats are more your thing than Dogecoin’s Shiba Ina, then there are plenty of feline coins in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most famous is , a blockchain-based game that lets you breed, buy, sell, and collect virtual kitties. It’s like Tomagotchi meets Beanie Babies, and your fur-baby’s coin value increases based on its unique genome and virtual DNA. A recent CryptoKitty sale fetched  If you just want a straight-up token minus the fun of creating a unique kitty, then Catcoin may be a better bet, but there are plenty of options out there for pet lovers. Did any of these eccentric coins make it into your digital wallet?",

    "detailContent": " That didn’t take long. Just a few hours after   on Tuesday morning, lawmakers in Congress told the social media giant to pump the brakes. Politicians on both sides of the aisle expressed their skepticism about . Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, told Facebook to stop development of the cryptocurrency until Congress could weigh in. “With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users,” Waters . “Given the company’s troubled past, I am requesting that  agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues and take action.” Facebook, along with major partners like Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal, hopes Libra can bring banking to the billions of people who currently don’t have access to financial services. For , it has the side benefit of giving users a way to buy and sell items without having to leave the  ecosystem. Along with the Calibra wallet app, you’ll be able to send and receive Libra on  Messenger and Whatsapp. “We look forward to responding to lawmakers’ questions as this process moves forward,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. But with Facebook under scrutiny after being accused of , lawmakers seem skeptical of Facebook’s ability to run its own currency. “Facebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users’ data without protecting their privacy,” said Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, in a statement. “We cannot allow  to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight.” Republicans were also not fans of Facebook’s crypto plans. Rep. Patrick McHenry, the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, wrote to Waters asking her to hold a hearing into the cryptocurrency. “We know there are many open questions as to the scope and scale of the project and how it will conform to our global financial regulatory framework,” he wrote in the letter. “It is incumbent on us as policymakers to understand Project Libra.” Libra is envisioned as a worldwide currency that seems aimed as much at rural India as it is at Americans. It’s not clear what, if any, authority the U.S. government would have over Libra. What’s certain is that Congress is going to want to have its say over a new financial system coming from some of America’s most influential companies.",

    "detailContent": " Facebook is getting into  It  on Tuesday, which it plans to launch in 2020. The company wants to be the one to bring the reported  into the world of financial services under its umbrella. But the company’s solution isn’t another Bitcoin — far from it. Libra, as the currency is known, is designed to allow  users to make purchases on the social network and on other websites online. Rather than a truly , like Bitcoin, Libra will be managed and controlled by Facebook and a consortium of companies like Visa and Mastercard. You’d be right to think it doesn’t sound much like your typical cryptocurrrency. But with ’s platform at its disposal, does Libra have the momentum to be the first cryptocurrency truly made for the masses? Libra has reportedly been under development for over a year at Facebook. Before , the social networking giant sought, and continues to seek, funding from companies to help develop Libra and grant them access to the consortium of firms that will manage it moving forward. These founding members of the “Libra Association,” have already been joined by major platforms like Booking.com, and Argentina-based ecommerce site, MercadoLibre, as well as Uber, Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal. Those are some big players in the digital banking world. The announcement has some cryptocurrency enthusiasts revving their engines, making some pretty big claims on Libra. The launch of Facebook’s cryptocurrency will go down in history as THE catalyst that propelled digital assets (including Bitcoin) to mass global consumer adoption. Will be remembered as just as important — and transformative — as the launch of the Netscape browser Buckle up — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert)  The potential is certainly there. Facebook’s gargantuan influence in messaging and social networking give it a reach and ease of access that few companies could hope to compete with. But Bitcoin fans are unlikely to be as impressed. Libra is not Bitcoin, even if it does share the same  and is built upon similarly open source software. It’s closest representative within the existing crypto-space , but that centralized cryptocurrency still isn’t quite what Libra is. Libra is more like Disney Dollars for an online ecosystem like . Although not as centralized as Ripple with a single company controlling its future, Libra is still set to be managed by a collection of large financial and technological organizations, as well as venture capitalists, telecoms, and academic institutions. Some of which will control the on-off ramps for investment. That flies in the face of the idea behind most cryptocurrencies. Take Bitcoin, for example. . It’s decentralized with no one entity able to exert control over its blockchain, or the transactions that take place on it. Libra is described as a “permissioned” network, which validates nodes and at this time, requires financial investment from them, to be considered. Where Bitcoin was designed to remove the gatekeepers from the financial world, Libra just makes Facebook and its association the only gatekeepers that matter. Their collective power makes them the only ones who can mint new Libra tokens, or burn (destroy) existing ones. With a two-thirds  voting on it, they could even theoretically lock people out of their Libra wallets, or block transactions from taking place entirely. With Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, none of that is possible. No one can control the money that goes into or out of Bitcoin. That’s one of its true strengths, but is also one of the reasons it’s faced difficulty with adoption on a mass-market scale. That probably won’t be an issue for Libra, but it does raise questions about the impartiality of the association and its members. Facebook and financial backers like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard will have a stake and a say in Libra’s ongoing development and though the white paper does claim that the plan is to make Libra permissionless in the future, there’s no guarantee of that. Research into it isn’t even scheduled to begin for another five years after the launch next year, so it’s quite possible such altruistic aims will be quietly forgotten about. There’s certainly nothing stopping new members of the association with radically different ideas about its operation from swaying that two thirds voting majority in the future. Another core tenet of Bitcoin is that it isn’t tied to anything hard in the real world, like traditional currencies. It’s worth what people are willing to pay for it. Libra, instead, will be linked with a number of real-world currencies. That means there won’t be such major swings in value, making for a more stable transactional medium in theory (also known as a “stablecoin”), but it also means that it could be affected by all the same real-world politics as fiat currencies. Cryptocurrency buyers often enjoy the benefits of their digital investment remaining siloed from fiat money, investing in it when their local currency is weak or fragile. If a global recession ever hits, Bitcoin will spike. Libra would presumably fall right along with dollars, pounds, and euros. There’s also the possibility that the association could cause swings in value by added new currencies or financial systems to base Libra’s value off. None of this means that Libra won’t be popular or useful in some cases. It has the potential to bring billions of people around to the idea of using cryptocurrencies and helping those without bank accounts in remote parts of the world process digital payments swiftly and easily. It could quite literally revolutionize the global financial landscape as we know it. In just a few short years, Libra could become an enormous endeavour and as intricate to our lives as any other social media function has become. But as we’ve seen with those same social networking firms, Libra raises concerns over impartiality, privacy, and monopolistic control over huge facets of our lives. Lofty promises have been made about the separation of church and state with association members and Libra money, but longtime cryptocurrency users will likely keep their distance for now. Libra is not Bitcoin and for many it is the very antithesis of it. That is cause for concern and a sceptical stance on Libra for now. Even if the developers’ intentions were altruistic, which they rarely are with the kinds of companies that already populate the Libra Association, there’s little stopping those goals from changing in the years to come. Even  after 20 years. But even if every Bitcoin user the world over doesn’t jump on Libra when it launches in the first half of 2020, your aunt probably will. And that’s exactly what Facebook is betting on.",

    "title": "Hackers Demanding Bitcoins for Code Held Hostage From GitHub, GitLab | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Hackers are demanding  payments in exchange for code that they have extracted from , GitLab, and Bitbucket repositories, through ransom notes that they have left behind for their victims. Hackers have  all the source code from the repositories, and in exchange is a ransom note that demands 0.1 bitcoin, which is equivalent to about $570. The hackers claim to be willing to send proof that they are indeed holding the code hostage, backed up on their own servers. “If we don’t receive your payment in the next 10 days, we will make your code public or use them otherwise,” the hackers wrote to end the ransom note. There were a total of 392 GitHub repositories that had their commits and code wiped out by an account named gitbackup, which was created seven years ago on January 25, 2012,  to Bleeping Computer. So far, none of the victims have succumbed and paid the ransom to the hackers, which is good as there is no assurance that the code will indeed be returned. It remains unclear how the hacker or hackers are gaining access to the repositories to be able to wipe out the stored codes and leave behind the ransom note. One user received a response from Atlassian, the company behind Bitbucket and the cross-platform free Git client SourceTree, regarding an attempted breach. “Within the past few hours, we detected and blocked an attempt — from a suspicious IP address — to log in with your Atlassian account. We believe that someone used a list of login details stolen from third-party services in an attempt to access multiple accounts,” Atlassian  the user. According to investigations by GitHub, in cooperation with the security teams of other affected companies, there was no evidence that the authentication systems of the repositories were compromised. It appears that the account credentials of the victims were acquired by hackers from third-party exposures, which is one of the risks of using a username and password in more than one service. GitHub recommends its customers to use two-factor authentication, in conjunction with strong passwords, for better protection. However, one victim said that the hackers were still able to gain access even with two-factor authentication enabled,  a vulnerability within GitHub’s systems.",

But it is debuting an expansion of its Azure cloud platform to include the Azure Blockchain Service, a new foundation for business-developed blockchain platforms that can help improve trust across organizations. The first one to sign up to this new preview service is J.P. Morgan with Quorum, a smart contract platform built upon the . Blockchain technology is most well known for being the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but over the years the technology has seen a variety of uses outside of that niche. Its ability to provide trust between organizations and individuals in the digital space has made it useful for voting machines, organizing medical records, and handling permissions in major companies. Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service is designed to expand the technology’s potential into a new sphere of cloud connected businesses. Since blockchain can be a little hard to wrap your head around at times — especially when it comes to its specific uses beyond the abstract — Microsoft’s new service is entirely managed to help simplify the creation and management of blockchain services and networks. We’re told that Microsoft has made it so that setting up a new distributed ledger is as simple as a few clicks. There are also easy to understand management features which helps to add new members or set permissions for anyone who’s using the service. The Microsoft Azure Blockchain Service also includes smart-contract functionality, which makes it possible for individuals and businesses to set specific conditions for completion of work, payments, and data access. Microsoft even released an extension for its Visual Studio code to make implementing them easier. J.P. Morgan has already partnered with Microsoft for its Quorum blockchain, bringing it over to Microsoft’s managed platform. That service has customers as diverse as Starbucks and Louie Vuitton, and Microsoft itself even uses it as part of its Xbox Finance Team. If you’re interested in trying out the Azure Blockchain Service, it’s now available in Preview. You can make a , and get $200 towards your first network.

    "detailContent": " As much as we love chips, candy bars, and soft drinks, who wouldn’t also want the option of being able to buy a nice cold beer or even, state-depending, some legalized weed from a ? The only problem with this is that it’s almost impossible to confirm the age of someone making a purchase without having a human overseer on site which, frankly, kind of defeats the point of a vending machine. San Francisco-based  has come up with a solution, however, and it’s one which should make it much easier for vendors to sell age-restricted products, and even offer personalized rewards to customers in the process. The essential idea behind the advance is to create special vending machines which work with a mobile app. This mobile app is based around Civic’s CVC cryptocurrency, whose big selling point is combining a coin with a personal identification system. The shortened version: You get to pay in cryptocurrency while simultaneously confirming that you’re old enough to buy whatever adult beverage or other product you’re hoping to purchase. “The user first downloads the Civic Pay app and they immediately go through a verification process,” Civic CEO Vinny Lingham told Digital Trends. “They verify their identity using a government-issued document and must pass a liveness test and selfie comparison. Once the user is verified, they can fund their account with CVCs. Then all the user has to do is scan the vending machine’s QR code to prove they are over 21 and provide payment. It’s as simple as that. The whole process generally takes a couple of seconds once the user is onboarded.” Civic has already shown off its vending machines at various exhibitions and tradeshows — including South by Southwest, where it received a favorable response. The next step is to bring the technology to customers all over the United States, and hopefully beyond. “We expect our partners to be rolling out vending machines with Civic software in upcoming months,” Lingham continued. “We expect upward of 1,000 vending machines to be integrated with Civic software by the end of the year, and look forward to growing that number in 2020.”",

It became such a popular concept that an iced tea company managed to  by placing “blockchain” in its name and promising to make use of the emerging technology. Well, while some of the mainstream popularity of the technology has waned,  hasn’t gone anywhere. And now German electronics company Bosch is planning to use the technology in an upcoming refrigerator. The company recently announced that it will be teaming up with Wien Energie, a major energy firm located in Austria, to create a new smart fridge that will sport blockchain related features, as well as some of the standard fare that you might expect from an Internet-connected appliance. To start, the refrigerator will apparently use energy that will be generated using blockchain technology. Owners will be able to see exactly where the energy is coming from and will have control over the source of their fridge’s power. That means users will be able to choose between sourcing energy from local solar panels, wind farms, and other alternatives. The sourcing will be controlled via a  app. In addition to the blockchain-powered features that the fridge will sport, it will also come with standard smart appliance options. That includes the ability to remotely control the temperature inside the fridge, receive alerts if the door is left open, and see a detailed account of electricity consumption that allows users to better track just how much their fridge is costing them on their monthly electricity bill. “We see the blockchain technology as an opportunity for us and are already testing the possibilities in practice with pilot customers. The goal is to make energy more accessible and comprehensible in the future,” Peter Gönitzer, CEO of Wien Energie, said in a statement. There are a lot of questions left unanswered regarding Bosch’s blockchain refrigerator, which appears more concept than reality at the moment. It’s not clear which blockchain it will use, when it will be available, or how much it will cost. For those looking to take more control over their energy consumption, the concept is something to look forward to.",

    "detailContent": " It sounds like the ultimate tongue-in-cheek sales pitch to target millennials: An environmentally friendly streaming music service that pays artists in Bitcoin, and plants trees in exchange for streams from customers. All you need are references to vaping and craft ale, and you’d have a comprehensive 20-something hipster bingo card. In fact, it’s a serious new venture by streaming music upstart  that targets indie musicians. In an attention-grabbing effort to carve out a niche in the shadow of giants like Spotify and Apple Music, it’s come up with a musician-friendly way to generate streaming royalties that are beneficial to artists and listeners alike — while maybe even helping save the planet in the process. “What we are trying to do is turn music streaming into something that directly fights climate change,” Graham Langdon, founder and CEO of Feedbands, told Digital Trends. “Our new platform plants one tree for every 100 qualified streams. In order to maximize our effectiveness, we are leveraging Bitcoin to provide incentives at every level: Paying artists more per stream than Spotify, paying listeners, and paying people per-stream rates when they sign up other listeners and artists. Our hope is that the incentives maximize the number of streams and thus, number of trees being planted.” Artists get paid 1 cent per stream, which works out to slightly more than double what Spotify pays out. Unlike Spotify (and every other streaming company out there), this is paid out in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Listeners, meanwhile, can earn Bitcoin by listening, as well as by scouting other listeners using a link embedded with a special referral code. As a result, they are able to passively earn Bitcoin by inviting other fans to use the platform. “We were , a search engine that returns the same results as Google, but plants trees as people search,” Langdon said while describing Feedbands’ origins. “They’ve planted over 50 million trees, and they’re planting another one every second. Lots of people out there are actively choosing services that are having a regenerative impact on the earth. It’s a movement that is happening now at the intersection of technology and the environment. We’ve also been following Bitcoin for years and believe that it will likely revolutionize every aspect of the economy and redistribute wealth much in the same way the internet did over the last few decades.” While there have been plenty of concerns voiced about the decidedly  (Feedbands disputes some of these findings), it’s certainly an interesting new approach to music streaming on several levels.",

    "title": "California Uses Blockchain and IoT to Manage Groundwater Use | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   The state is an agricultural powerhouse,  of the United States’ vegetables and generating over $50 billion in a year, but its vast and varied output requires a similarly colossal amount of water. For decades, farmers and businesses have pumped groundwater out of California’s aquifers, the permeable layers of rock that hold water underground, and the results have been frightening. As aquifers drain faster than rain can replenish them, the ground actually sinks, a phenomenon called “subsidence.” In areas where building and roads rest atop the ground, this can cause damage. “California is huge for American agriculture,” Alex Johnson, Freshwater Fund Director for The Freshwater Trust, told Digital Trends. “But it’s heavily groundwater dependent, and there are some basins in the central valley that have been so depleted over the last couple decades that they are 20 feet lower in elevation because those aquifers have been drained and all the ground is settling.” As the aquifers sink, they don’t merely pose a risk to infrastructure on the ground. Rock and soil collapse together, removing the space where water could once accumulate. This could be catastrophic, as , in average year groundwater accounts for 38 percent of the state’s water supply; in dry years that number can jump beyond 46 percent. If California is going to prevent further depletion of aquifers and survive droughts like the one that afflicted it from 2011 to 2017, the state will need to manage its groundwater usage. In the central valley, a group of organizations is working on a project that could stem the tide by combining two technologies: the internet of things (IoT) and Blockchain. The first big challenge was figuring out how to monitor groundwater levels across the state. Luckily, this is an issue that people in other regions of the globe have been grappling with for years, and have already developed solutions for. “We’re primarily doing this today in East Africa,” says Evan Thomas, CEO of SweetSense, a company that uses satellite-connected sensors to monitor rural water supplies. “There’s actually 30 percent less rainfall over East Africa over the past every year for 30 years,” he explains, “so drought is basically every year now, instead of every ten or 20 years, and the consequences of drought are really severe. 250,000 people died in 2011 because of the drought in Ethiopia and Kenya, and almost ten million people were impacted.” In Kenya, SweetSense partnered with IBM Research, and with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), they built a system to use IoT sensors to “monitor groundwater use and demand, correlate that to rainfall surface water availability, and then also, most importantly, use that data to identify when a water pump fails so that we can go out and get it fixed and make sure that people have access to water year round.” The use of IoT is exciting: Here is a technology many people associate first with kitchen appliances and  speakers, being used to save lives from drought. IoT, the internet of things, refers, broadly, to the ability of machines to communicate with each other. Here is a technology many people associate first with appliances and Alexa speakers, being used to save lives from drought. Imagine the modern, techie apartment: You might have a smart home hub that, when the clock strikes 7 a.m., tells your smart speaker to play an alarm, your coffee machine to start brewing a pot, your TV to turn on and change the channel to the morning news. If the temperature outside is below a certain threshold, your smart thermostat cranks up the heat. Although you may have programmed these instructions initially, the machines can “talk” to each other and carry out instructions without a human micromanaging them. Importantly, devices can communicate with each other without syncing up with the wider internet, and this is crucial for SweetSense’s work in Africa. “The reason that it’s IoT is we’re completely off-grid,” Thomas explains. “There’s no cellular service, there’s no power, there’s no utility hookups, so we have a self-contained, solar-powered sensor that’s attached to these pumps that can monitor water supply and connect it over satellite networks.” The sensors can fit in a person’s palm, and are powered by a “2-watt solar panel which is the size of a small paperback book.” Being able to accurately measure groundwater use is a crucial step, but it’s not enough to simply have accurate instruments. Groundwater is a uniquely complicated resource to manage. It all lies underground, out of sight, and because of how crucial it is to a variety of industries, everybody wants their sip at the fountain. “I think there’s an inherent difficulty in water management and natural resource management where it’s hard to track who does what and keep track of that over time,” Johnson says. “There’s not a lot of trust between users, especially between users and the government or local management agencies to other entities wanting the same resource.” Groundwater usage is an excellent example of the , the idea that presented with a shared resource, individuals will decide to maximize their own use of it, despite the fact that, if everybody does so, it could deplete the resource and doom the group. Management of a shared resource like water, one that people feel naturally entitled to, requires not just the survival of the group depends on everyone rationing their use. It requires trust. Each individual wants to know that everyone else is playing by the same rules. “Water is a shared resource,” says Nathan Wangusi, Technical Lead for Water at IBM Research Africa, “which means if we are extracting from the same aquifer we need to have conditions about how much we’re extracting, what rate we’re extracting at … so that idea of consensus is very important.” Wangusi and his team work in Kenya, in a region he describes as “sparsely populated” and “largely pastoral … heavily dependent on groundwater.” It’s also a region in which it’s hard to deploy many technological solutions. Wangusi and his team decided to focus on how to monetize water rights. “You think of any other natural resource, like minerals, land, access to ability to pollute,” Wangusi explains, “you get those rights through some permit … if you have a carbon credit, you get some permit to put a certain amount of carbon into the environment.” Likewise, if you own land, you can grow crops and have a right to sell those crops. If you own a mine, you can extract minerals from it and sell them. Groundwater is trickier though. “What’s different about water rights, more so than other natural resource rights, is that you cannot convert water rights directly … into a commercial instrument.” Wangusi and his team settled on the idea of groundwater credits. A credit provides the owner the right to extract a set amount of water from the ground, and if the owner doesn’t want to make use of that right themselves, they can “convert them into commercial instruments that you can trade in an open market.” Markets are about trust, however. The people involved need to trust that the product they are buying — in this case the right to extract groundwater — is valid, and they need to trust that nobody else is gaming the system. Why would a farmer restrict themselves to only the water they can afford to buy a permit for if they suspect their neighbor is pumping water with reckless abandon? Everyone needs to have access to that information, and know that the information is trustworthy. “The technology that is designed to support consensus and democratized access to information,” Wangusi says, “is by definition Blockchain, because you have this idea of a ledger that is immutable, and then you have the idea of a smart contract that can move transactions within that Blockchain network.”  that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but it has a lot of potential for other applications. Put simply, a Blockchain is a decentralized ledger, shared among everybody who wants access to it. When any number of parties make a transaction or other deal (say, registering a “smart contract”) on the Blockchain, the other parties on the network verify it and secure its place in the record. The information is available to all users, and nobody can alter it after the fact, because the data has to line up with the copies everyone else has. SweetSense’s sensors can accurately track the amount of groundwater pulled up from any pump in the system, and convey that information to IBM’s Blockchain via satellites, so the data flows even in remote areas. On the Blockchain, users can buy and sell their water credits, even registering smart contracts to automatically buy or sell when the price is right, and everyone can see which pumps are functional or not, where water is being pumped, and so on. The system, developed in Africa, is a boon for the pastoral communities that depend on groundwater there. To the Freshwater Trust, it also appeared to have a lot of potential for California. Although people might not immediately link Kenya and California in their minds, both regions rely on agriculture, and both rely on groundwater. Thomas had worked with the Freshwater Trust in the past, and they saw a chance to collaborate. “Because TFT was trying to figure out how to help farmers actually monitor water and how to help farmers comply with the Groundwater Sustainability Act,” Thomas says, “and most importantly, how to help them in a way that eases the pain of new regulations and creates market incentives for participating.” The creators of the project were excited by the prospect of what they call “reverse technology transfer,” of a system engineered in the developing world coming to help California, the heart of the tech world. “It’s easy, I think, in American culture, to feel like we’re the best,” Johnson says. “Because we’ve been told that, or we’ve told ourselves that a lot. There are lots of places where innovation is happening, and I think the speed of technology has democratized where some of those really interesting technological advancements come from.” Given California’s central role in the tech industry, there is a bit of irony there, the great exporter of innovation drawing on technology from a far-away land. “California is pretty techy in a very specific sense,” Johnson says, “and that generally isn’t around agriculture. So I think there’s probably lots of areas where the developing world has teachings and has innovations that can teach the developed world that.” Humanity’s back may not be pressed against the wall yet, but we can feel it looming. What this IoT/Blockchain system offers is a way of regulating groundwater usage that is transparent and incorruptible, which is helpful given that farmers, whether in Kenya or California, can be wary of government mandates. “If we can create a system that is credible, that is immutable, and shows that overall that resource, month after month, year after year, is being managed sustainably, but gives the users the privacy and the security that they need to actually use that system,” Johnson says, “now we’re talking.” “The legislation is going to force demand for these new types of systems,” he adds, and so organizations like the Freshwater Trust are trying “to figure stuff out before everybody’s back is against the wall …” Humanity’s back may not be pressed against the wall yet, but we can feel it looming. “We don’t have water available year-round, really anywhere in the world, and it’s becoming a crisis,” says Thomas. “Drought is exacerbating this issue, demand is exacerbating this issue, and we need to make sure that water is available where it needs to be and when it needs to be. And we aren’t going to be able to do that the old way,” he adds. “We’re not just going to build new dams again, or steal all of the water out of the mountains. We need to be able to manage the water where it is.” Drought doesn’t just hurt agriculture. A recent statement from the USDA Forest Service  18 million trees have died in California since 2017, bringing the total dead since 2010 to 149 million. Those husks stretch across millions of acres, a sea of kindling waiting for a spark. California’s prolonged drought has coincided with an increase in wildfires, including the 2018 Camp Fire,  in California’s history. It’s going to take robust public policy and technological innovation to stave off disaster, and California is leveraging both. “We as humans have access to almost godlike technology right now,” Johnson says. “Let’s have a sense of urgency and try things and apply some of these technologies where they are most needed.”",

    "detailContent": "  is more than just a problem for academia. The falsifying of results can lead to incorrect information spreading out into the world and can have  as well as undermining the credibility of science among the general public. Now a group of researchers have proposed a way to make research data more trustworthy and less susceptible to manipulation — by using blockchain. Researchers at the University of California, San Fransico (UCSF) created a proof of concept that shows how the integrity of clinical trial data can be protected and proven using blockchain.  allows users to track the changes made to any portion of the data entered into it, making an audit trail for regulators which can be checked for any inconsistencies. This would make it obvious if, for example, a researcher changes certain values in their data set to come to the conclusion that they wanted. An advantage of this method is that auditors don’t need to see or even to really understand the specific data that they are looking at — they just need to check for any changes to it. This should make auditing easier as it won’t require such expert knowledge of the topic. The system works through a web portal so that the entry of data is tracked and each new piece of data is recorded onto a new block. The idea is that researchers could use the web portal to record their results in real time, and these results can then be checked by a supervisory body like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “It makes it really obvious when someone’s changing something,” lead author Daniel Wong said in a . “You can see who put their hands on it, who made it, who changed it, and who received it.” Co-author of the paper, Atul Butte, believes that this development could have real uses in ensuring scientific integrity. “Everyone is talking about how blockchain is going to revolutionize many of the data challenges in medicine, and here is one use that finally might make sense,” he said in the same . “We think it could someday be useful for pharma companies running clinical trials.” The paper is published in the journal .",

    "title": "Sirin Labs Finney Hands-on review | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The  is a smartphone built for , designed to prepare us for a future, decentralized world where cryptocurrency is used to . Sounds cool, but , the , and everything around it is confusing and definitely not for the faint of heart. Therefore it’s tempting to run a mile from the Finney, but Sirin Labs is so completely invested in making it work for everyone — Blockchain advocate or otherwise — that it’s impossible to ignore, or be caught up in their enthusiasm. Can it really be so simple to carry cryptocurrency securely on your phone, use it when possible, and for that device to be worth the $1,000 asking price? The answer is no, not really, but that’s not entirely the Finney’s fault. Strap in as we explore why. The Sirin Labs Finney bears a family resemblance to the , the first phone made by the company before it pivoted from luxury $13,000 smartphones to the blockchain phone company you see today. It’s no bad thing. The Finney is definitely individual-looking, avoiding the standard black oblong we’re used to seeing by sharpening up the top and bottom edge, chamfering the sides, and curving the glass and metal rear panel to match. The build quality is good apart from a slightly out-of-place lip where the screen meets the top of the phone. The 203 gram phone feels solid and at 9.3mm thick, it’s decently comfortable to hold. However, it’s slippery and we often felt like we’d drop it. Annoyingly, the rear mounted fingerprint sensor is slightly too low on the body, and our finger naturally fell on the camera lens — not ideal, and reminiscent of the old . There’s a reason the fingerprint sensor and the camera lens are low down on the rear panel: There’s a second 2-inch OLED screen that slides up from the top of the device. This is the Finney’s secret weapon, a secure cold (meaning disconnected from the internet) wallet to store cryptocurrency. When we first saw the phone, we questioned whether we’d constantly be popping this up and down, but we don’t, and it’s because you need two hands to open it. The mechanism is quite stiff, and there’s no special grippy surface so you can open it with just your thumb. Instead, you have to grip the top of the phone and slide the screen up. Once the cold wallet is open, it does wobble about a little, and we definitely think it will break if too much pressure is put on it from the front. This is at odds with the rest of the phone, and we fear that if the open cold wallet screen gets a hard knock, it’ll snap. The presence of the cold wallet also seems to balance the Finney, weight-wise, in a top heavy manner. Holding it at the base to type, for example, does emphasise the slipperiness of the phone, and it feels like it may topple out of your hand. All this aside, no-one is going to mistake the Finney for an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy. It’s distinct, different, and pleasingly premium. Getting involved in cryptocurrency is the top reason most will buy the Finney. We opted to receive a “virgin” review model as this will be how buyers will receive it, although Sirin Labs did offer to provide one that already had the cold wallet set up. It’s easy to see why: Set up is a royal pain in the blockchain. To get started you use the Finney Wallet app that’s pre-installed, which prompts you to open the cold wallet. If it’s the first time, you have to go through a lengthy and sometimes frustrating setup process. Job one is to pick a password. This protects actual money, so it needs to be secure, and you definitely don’t want to lose it. It’s entered on the 2-inch OLED cold wallet screen, rather than on the phone’s keyboard. Letters, numbers, and symbols are selected from a side-scrolling list, navigated slowly using left and right arrow keys. This needs to be done twice, and it’s fiddly as the screen is close to the top of the phone. Because it’ll be the first time you’re using it, the learning curve is severe. Push through, and it does feel a little more natural, but it’s not a great first impression. Then you get a list of 24 words to remember, called Seed words. You are immediately tested on  identifying all 24 in a multiple choice quiz, and if you get it wrong, you have to start the registration process again. If you’re new to all this, it’s something of a surprise, and errors generally are not tolerated by the Finney. We finally set it all up on the fourth attempt, after getting annoyed with the screen, accidentally mistyping our long secure password and getting kicked back to the start, eventually entering it correctly, then being confronted with a list of unrelated words (without explanation), which we promptly forgot. Although the wallet is now set up, doing anything is a laborious process if your password is complicated and long, which it should be. Yes, payments can be made quickly when your password is “ahhhh,” but not when it’s 30 characters long and a mix of upper and lower case letters, and various symbols. At this point, you’ve got an empty wallet waiting to be filled up. What happens next depends on whether you own any Bitcoin or Ethereum currency already. We’re going to work on the assumption that you don’t, as this was our situation. The Finney Wallet does not provide any way to directly buy cryptocurrency, so you have to go to a third-party app or other service. Being entirely new to this, we were recommended  to make our first purchase, although it’s not the only option out there. Don’t expect this to be a fast system if you’re connecting a bank account — it took a day to get approval, and then several hours to receive funds ready to make crypto purchases. Transferring from Coinbase to the Finney wallet is simple enough, provided you have Coinbase installed on your phone. But again, it takes time. Nothing happens quickly in cryptocurrency, from what I saw. With all the work getting crypto into my wallet complete, what’s next? You can try and spend it, but this isn’t easy — one coffee shop in London is listed as accepting crypto, and it’s miles away from where I live — meaning it’s a little bit of a letdown. It’s hardly the most easily usable feature right now, although that may change in the future. Ultimately, if you’re a newcomer to cryptocurrency, do not expect the Finney phone to make this baffling world much less confusing and problematic. I carried on with the process because it’s my job, but if it wasn’t, I may have given up a lot sooner. Getting set up involves a lot of trust in companies you won’t be familiar with, using products and technology that are completely new, for very little benefit. The Finney, for all its basic accessibility, does little to convince me some bright crypto-future is very close. The Finney is guilty of a particularly heinous crime — it has a notch in the screen, which serves no purpose whatsoever. The phone has thick bezels above, below and around the screen for a start. Next, the Finney doesn’t have any kind of face unlock, so there’s no additional sensors, and worst of all, the notch simply holds the phone’s speaker. Viewed this way, it removes screen real estate, and looks out of place. Perhaps its presence is necessitated by the cold wallet, but phones like the  manage to work around any pop-up module problems, so this seems unlikely. Even if it is a forced design decision, it looks like Sirin Labs is jumping on the bandwagon for the sake of it, and that’s not good. That said, the 6-inch, 2,160 x 1,080 pixel screen is not lacking brightness or detail, but it’s a very ‘cold’ display. Compare it to the beautiful warmth of the  or the , and the stark blues and whites really show up. Sirin Labs has not put much emphasis on the Finney’s camera. It’s a single lens, 12-megapixel camera with a f/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization, and an HDR mode. It shoots 4K video at 60fps and has electronic image stabilization. The camera app is the basic Android app, and Google Photos is used for albums. All rather ordinary by today’s standards. There’s no portrait mode, no hybrid zoom, no flashy night mode, nothing. This makes it a bit … boring. While the cryptocurrency stuff captures the headlines, the Finney is still an expensive phone that we have to use every day. Single camera lenses can be great, just look at the  and the , but when they’re barebones in terms of features, we’re left nonplussed. However, despite the lack of fancy features, it does take solid photos. Colors are bright and realistic during the day, and it handles problematic overcast days very well, accentuating a blue sky that was only just visible to the naked eye. Food photos were good too, and the Finney made the colors pop, while keeping the subject appetizing. Even low light impressed. Yes, grey skies lack realism, but there’s limited noise, and plenty of detail. Weirdly, the front facing 8-megapixel camera does have a software-driven portrait mode to add bokeh or blur. It’s decent too, picking out faces and body shapes well even under harsh indoor light. However, the low megapixel count and f/2.2 aperture limit the amount of detail, and the selfies are not our favourites. Put the Finney alongside the  and the difference is immense. The iPhone’s selfie gives my face color and life. The Finney makes me look washed out and lifeless. I know which one I’d want to share. For $1,000, we’re left disappointed by the Finney’s camera. The Finney is a 2018 flagship Android phone with a Snapdragon 845 processor and 6GB of RAM, along with 128GB of internal storage and a MicroSD card slot. Certainly enough for most tasks, but it has already been surpassed in terms of chipset ability and RAM expectations. Does this mean it’s slow? No, of course not. We put it through our benchmark tests to assess its capability. We played a selection of games, with  and  taking up the most amount of time. Despite not looking like a gaming phone at all, the Finney is great for the casual gamer. Asphalt 8 is really enjoyable, with plenty of speed and a smooth frame rate, but what really enhances it is the shape of the Finney itself. The curved sides make holding it in landscape very comfortable over long periods. It’s a surprisingly strong gaming device. Android 8.1.0 is installed on the Finney, with the January 2019 security patch. This means it’s missing out on , and therefore already technically out-of-date. Sirin Labs has customized Android with its own user interface called Sirin OS, which is a key part of the company’s long-term strategy. It hopes to license it to other manufacturers making crypto-focused phones due to its security features. Sirin Labs has plenty of experience here, having adapted the Solarin’s highly-secure operating system for use on the Finney. It comes with the Sirin OS Cyber Security Centre installed, which monitors the device for threats and other security issues in real-time. The list of security features is extensive, and just as confusing as Bitcoin, with an intrusion protection system with machine learning, network attack protection, cyber threat protection, and the promise of security updates on a regular basis. That’s before all the firewall and secure elements protecting the wallet. If you want mobile security, only BlackBerry comes close to the Finney, though it’s hard to say how much of all this really works. Other apps installed include the Finney Wallet and the dCenter app store (more on this soon). Otherwise, Sirin OS operates just like regular Android. Apps are stored in a slide-up app tray, Google Assistant is called up using a long press of the home button — no fancy gesture controls here — and the overall look has been left alone. The Finney has its own app store for decentralized apps, called the dCenter. At the moment it contains 16 apps, most of which feature Pokémon Go-style collectables, sometimes in an augmented reality world, but all revolve around mining a token in the hope that presumably, it’ll be worth something more in the future. If you want to play a game, you know, for fun, the Google Play Store seems like a better bet. The constant mention of blockchain and mining will put off those unfamiliar with the technology. Then there are the incentivized apps. These provide a financial reason to watch videos and interact with apps, rewarding you with some cryptocurrency. At the time of writing there were two campaigns, and I watched two very dull videos about the blockchain, for which I earned 7,500KUE, and 1,300SWC. Lucky me, right? Well, this currency is stored in my Finney Wallet, but as to what I can do with it, how much it’s worth — if anything — and the general benefit of having it at all is a complete mystery. Sirin Labs says in the future, more incentivized apps will arrive and it’ll be possible to offset the outright cost of the phone. One final performance point worth noting is the speed with which the Finney starts up. It’s lightning fast, and it’s ready to go after just a few seconds. Compared to slowcoaches like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, it’s very refreshing. The Finney has a 3,260mAh battery cell, and this relatively small size is reflected in its standby and use time. A day is the absolute maximum to expect here, and if you’re a heavy user, you may need to recharge it to help get you through a long one. Running a video test on the device from 100-percent to zero, it played a full-screen YouTube video at maximum brightness over Wi-Fi for six hours and 45 minutes. Quick Charge 4.0 is onboard to recharge fully in about two hours, or 50-percent in approximately 30 minutes. Today you can buy the Finney phone for $900, a slight reduction to the $1,000 MSRP, from . However, this lower price appears to be a limited time offer. It comes with a 14-day money back guarantee. It’s also scheduled to be available through Amazon’s Launchpad program. The device is not sold by carriers, but will operate on most global GSM networks including those in the U.S.. Sirin Labs provides a 12-month warranty internationally and 24-months in Europe, covering any defects, but not accidental damage. It’s a return service, so the phone will go back to Sirin Labs for repair, which will take less than 14 days. Living with the Finney has made it very clear that cryptocurrency is not ready for mainstream use yet. The problem is its main feature is only compelling to those who use, understand, and believe in cryptocurrency and the Blockchain. Yes, with patience, the total newcomer can have a secure crypto wallet set up on the Finney, but we just don’t see why you’d want to, or need to, at the moment. Take away the cold wallet, cryptocurrency tools, and blockchain features and you’re left with a decent, super secure, but ultimately unremarkable smartphone. If you are set on buying a smartphone with a built-in cold storage wallet, the Finney is your only choice.  may do something similar, but we’re still waiting for its release. For now, the Finney stands alone. If you’ve got $1,000 for a new smartphone, the choice of alternatives is absolutely huge. If the cold storage wallet is something you want to play with, but don’t know anything about cryptocurrency, your money will definitely be better spent elsewhere. The $900  or the $1,100  are vastly superior smartphones, as is the $1,000 . Depending on its availability where you live, the 900 British pound  is a superb purchase too. Wait a while, and you’ll have the  to look at as well. You can spend half the cost of the Finney on a  or the , or even a third on something like the , and then have more than enough left over to buy a standalone cold storage wallet from a  too. If you really want a phone with something that pops up out the top, there’s the . We have some slight concerns over the durability of the pop-up cold wallet, and there’s nothing more than IP52 dust and water resistance, so it’s not going to survive anything too harsh. The Android version is already out of date, and because Sirin OS deeply customizes the operating system, updates to  or later may take a while to arrive. The Snapdragon 845 processor has already been superseded, but the phone still remains powerful and capable. Cryptocurrency and the Blockchain are still emerging technologies, which may mean the Finney is ahead of the curve and will stay fresher for longer should this be the reason you want to purchase it. However, because the technology is still being shaped, there’s a chance alterations could render the Finney less useful in the future too. Technically, the phone will remain useable for two years at the minimum though, just like other modern smartphones. If you’re simply curious about cryptocurrency, then no. The Finney certainly won’t demystify it for you, or suddenly revolutionize your world. If you already own cryptocurrency, or regularly speculate in the market, then there may be more for you here. But because the phone itself doesn’t excite, you can buy better everyday phones for the same money or less. The Finney phone is genuinely ahead of its time, it’s just that for once, this isn’t really a selling point.",

    "detailContent": " JPMorgan Chase is rolling out a trial in the next few months of the first cryptocurrency backed by a major United States bank. Dubbed “JPM Coin,” the cryptocurrency will be used by big business across the world to “instantly settle payments between clients,” according to a . Currently, only large clients of JPMorgan Chase will be able to cash in on the new cryptocurrency, so it is out of reach for the average consumer. These big money clients typically include major broker-dealers who have passed regulatory checks. JPM Coin will also only be redeemable for one U.S. dollar, so its value will be linked to the dollar, unlike Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. To receive JPM Coins, a Chase client will first have to deposit dollars at the institution, and once a transaction is completed the coins will then be withdrawn and converted back to a corresponding amount of dollars. “So anything that currently exists in the world, as that moves onto the blockchain, this would be the payment leg for that transaction,” said Umar Farooq, head of J.P. Morgan’s blockchain projects to CNBC. “The applications are frankly quite endless; anything where you have a distributed ledger which involves corporations or institutions can use this.” Farooq went on to explain to CNBC that JPM Coin can be used in three methods, including for international payments and securities transactions. With international payments, large corporations will no longer have to use wire transfers when moving big sums of money. The transfer process can be sped up and payments can happen right away, without the need to wait. Secondly, with securities transactions, JPM Coin can be used by investors to settle the transactions right away, again cutting out the need to use wire services. JPMorgan Chase might be taking a big bet with JPM Coin, but it still holds significant potential in changing business across the world. There’s hope that large corporations can use JPM Coin in treasury services. “The final use would be for huge corporations that use J.P Morgan’s treasury services business to replace the dollars they hold in subsidiaries across the world,” reports CNBC.",

    "title": "Password Mishap Leaves Crypto Exchange Unable to Repay Clients\u0027 $190 Million | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The death of a crypto exchange founder has rendered the exchange unable to repay $190 million to its clients. When QuadrigaCX founder Gerald Cotten passed away in December 2018, the exchange lost access to the funds required to pay back its customers the $190 million it owes them. QuadrigaCX lost access to these funds because the password required to access them wasn’t known to anyone except Cotten himself. As a result, the Canadian crypto exchange has filed for “creditor protection” in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy, according to . Apparently the password-protected funds are kept in “cold storage” and the only funds available to QuadrigaCX are stored in a “hot wallet.” The exact amounts of money stored in either the cold storage or hot wallet are currently unknown, although  that the bulk of the money needed to repay Quadriga’s customers is being held in cold storage. Cotten’s widow, Jennifer Robertson shed a little light on how the funds were normally handled,  filed last month with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. In the affidavit, Robertson said that Cotten “would move the majority of the coins to cold storage as a way to protect the coins from hacking or other virtual theft.” While Robertson does not have business records for QuadrigaCX, she did get Cotten’s laptop. Unfortunately, she has been unable to access the contents of the encrypted laptop, as no one has the password or recovery key for it. Attempts to decrypt the laptop have not been successful. 115,000 customers (with balances) could be affected by QuadrigaCX’s inability to pay the $190 million. Not to mention the roughly $50 million in fiat the exchange also owes. According to that same affidavit, the exchange is supposed to have $147 million in total. Quadriga’s customers have reported being unable to withdraw their funds from the exchange for months and have  about the status of their accounts and about the fact that Quadriga’s website went down for maintenance last week. Selling off Quadriga’s operating platform has been mentioned as an option for the exchange, as doing so may allow it to help pay its customers back. Selling off the operating platform may not help matters much if the troubled crypto exchange is unable to secure a court hearing on February 5 that confirms a “stay of proceedings.” Such a stay could stop lawsuits against the exchange from going forward and would be expected to prevent “further damages” to Quadriga’s customers, according to Robertson’s affidavit.",

    "detailContent": " In a world in which people increasingly pay for things using mobile wallets like Apple Pay, the presence of the machines you find at grocery stores, which turn your spare change into a more useful note-based form of cash, seem kind of retro. But they’re about to embrace one of the most exciting currency-based innovations happening right now — by allowing users to convert their regular cash into Bitcoin. “Coinstar is always looking for new ways to offer value to our consumers when they visit our kiosks, and Coinme’s innovative delivery mechanism along with Coinstar’s flexible platform makes it possible for consumers to easily purchase Bitcoin with cash,” , CEO of Coinstar, the company behind the change-counting kiosks, in a statement. It’s the latest example of how Bitcoin is becoming accessible to folks who want to invest, just . Coinstar isn’t the only company helping with this, of course. For a few years now, a number of dedicated ATMs around the world have allowed users to trade the popular cryptocurrency. However, making Bitcoin gathering accessible in grocery stores and other locations around the U.S. is sure to make a difference in terms of overall visibility. You won’t be able to use your nickel and dimes to , though. Instead, the decision has been made to only let customers purchase the cryptocurrency using paper money. Given how expensive Bitcoin is — even with the price down considerably from its all-time highs — that’s probably an understandable decision on the part of Coinstar. Provided that you’re at a participating machine, users can buy their Bitcoin by selecting “Buy Bitcoin” as an option. They must then enter their phone number and the details of the transaction they wish to make. Following this, customers will receive a redemption code, which they can use on the . It’s not clear how many of Coinstar’s machines will be offering Bitcoin. This isn’t the first time that Coinstar has shown willingness to jump aboard the digital payments bandwagon. A few years ago, it  to allow customers to convert their loose change into currency that can be easily used online.",

    "title": "Cryptocurrency in 2019: Will Governments Help Bitcoin and Others Rebound? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Are you following Bitcoin? You know, the cryptocurrency that went from being worth less than a penny in 2010 to peaking at nearly $20,000 in late 2017, then ? So, what happened? Is it dead? Can it survive the next year? explosion in value throughout 2017 launched more than 1,600 new cryptocurrencies — and they seemed like unstoppable money-making machines … until Bitcoin lost 83 percent of its value in 2018. And so have nearly all of it’s spinoffs. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are each down 98 percent, Etherium and Litecoin are both down 93 percent, and others, like BitConnect, have lost 100 percent of their value in the last year and shut down entirely. So is this the end of cryptocurrency? Was it just a fad? Are currencies like Bitcoin just digital Beanie Babies, or is there hope in the new year? Well, let’s talk about what actually caused the crypto market to crash. In a nutshell, a lot of the excitement that led to the massive bubble focused on cryptocurrency being unregulated and untraceable by authorities. Well, it turned out that when put to the test, a lot of those claims turned out to be too good to be true. As governments and financial institutions took a closer look, they discovered that a decentralized currency creates a huge number of regulatory problems – most importantly in terms of preventing tax evasion and crypto being used for illegal transactions. So they cracked down – India for example announced that it  from doing business with cryptocurrency exchanges, and most first-world countries have stated that crypto is NOT legal tender, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union as a whole. Another major problem was the total lack of security surrounding investments and banking. A few massive exchanges have shut down, most notably  – which lost 850,000 Bitcoins, which at their peak were worth $1.7 trillion dollars, and filed for liquidation, with little recourse left for those who had trusted the exchange to keep their money safe. Although some of the currency was recovered, the event, and others like it, proved that unlike traditional banks and currencies,  without further regulation. These issues, coupled with the massive uptick in energy necessary to mine bitcoin, brought it’s dramatic rise to a dramatic halt. So where does that leave us in 2019? Have these challenges proven that cryptocurrency is dead? Actually, not at all. Although the original excitement has hit a dead end, crypto HAS seen success in an unexpected way. Around the world, a number of countries have started experimenting with their own cryptocurrency – subject to to their own regulations and protections. Sweden, for example, is gearing up to launch a digital currency to complement its national currency that will eventually branch off and exist as it’s own cryptocurrency once stable. In short, the country has fully embraced the idea of a regulated cashless future. Other countries, , which recently saw a total economic collapse, have turned to cryptocurrency as a way out of financial messes. The “petro” is ostensibly backed by five billion barrels of oil and will be tied directly to the cost of oil rather than the existing weak economy.   In fact, a number of countries that are struggling economically because of sanctions — including Iran, North Korea, Syria, and even Russia — have been looking at decentralized cryptocurrency as a way to bypass economic sanctions. So while the lack of regulation has been killing crypto, in a very backwards — and technically illegal — way, it may end up boosting their the currencies’ once again. It’s often said that the private sector innovates, and the government appropriates and regulates — and that’s exactly what’s happening to cryptocurrency. But maybe that’s actually a good thing in the long run. Especially for anyone who wants to jump on the crypto bandwagon. Because the biggest problem with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is that they’re not actually based on a tangible good. It may be called “digital gold,” but unlike gold, there’s no actual value for bitcoin beyond a bunch of ones and zeroes that consume as much electricity as the entire country of Ireland. And while you may be thinking that ones and zeros aren’t much better than a piece of paper, those other paper currencies are backed by actual countries — in other words, people and labor, and resources. So while freestanding cryptocurrency has taken a beating, country-backed cryptocurrency may just see a resurgence in 2019 — and if you’re not totally sick of crypto after the last year, it may be a good idea to shift your focus. You might just make a little money after all.",

    "title": "The First Bitcoin Was Born Ten Years Ago Today. How Far We\u0027ve Come | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Bitcoin is 10 years old today. You might have read about the  back in October 2018, but that was merely for the original Whitepaper published by the pseudonymous . Today is the 10 year anniversary of the day the first Bitcoin came into existence. It’s the decade-old anniversary of the mining of the genesis block. Why is this significant? Well, the genesis block is the very first block in the  that powers every function of Bitcoin and . It’s a unique link in the chain because it’s the very first one — the only block in the entire digital infrastructure that is not tied to a previous block. This genesis block came into existence on January 3, 2009, so today we celebrate its birth, for good or for bad. Let’s look back on a decade of  and how it’s changed over the years. In completing the mining of that first block, Satoshi Nakamoto earned 50 Bitcoins for the trouble. Worth nothing at the time, today such a sum could be sold for more than $200,000 and a year ago would have fetched almost five times that. The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining hardware all over the world is equivalent to that of a small country. One of the more notable factors of that earliest of mining efforts and those that followed in the months after, was that the rewards were far higher and the difficulty of the mining was a fraction of a percent of what it is today.  coverage of Bitcoin mining difficulty over the years highlights that the difficulty remained at a round “1” hash until the very last day of that year. That meant that you could mine Bitcoins with the weakest of consumer grade CPUs and still have a good chance of being rewarded with Bitcoins. In the years that followed, as exchanges were founded and trading became more organized among Bitcoin evangelists, the difficulty of mining rose significantly, requiring more and more powerful processors, then graphics cards, and then in 2013, the application specific integrated circuits, or . Those micro-computers were and are designed specifically to mine Bitcoin and they offer performance far in excess of even the most powerful of graphics cards. That lead to a whole new arms race in the Bitcoin mining wars and the difficulty exploded in turn.   By the end of 2013 Bitcoin difficulty had crested a Gigahash for the first time. That’s more than a thousand, thousand, thousand times as difficult as the mining of the genesis block. Since then it’s increased thousands of times more and today the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining hardware all over the world is . Solving blocks also delivers far less of a reward to miners – just 12.5 Bitcoins per block – and the competition is so fierce that only  with , stand to make much of a profit – especially considering Bitcoin’s recent pricing crash. Even though the downturn in the value of the cryptocurrency has lead to the first reduction in Bitcoin mining difficulty in months and the most significant in its history, it seems unlikely that people will ever stop mining it. , so those with the most to lose believe that there isn’t much risk in “” on a little longer at least. Over the years to come, Bitcoin mining will continue and the trickle of tokens will turn into a drip as more and more of the maximum 21 million Bitcoins are mined and released into the wild. We passed  and we’re set to pass 83 percent by the end of it. It might take as long as 100 years to mine the very last Bitcoin, with the rewards continue to halve every few years throughout that time. But assuming the cryptocurrency is still around at that point, miners will need to continue in some guise to process transactions on the blockchain. They do have an important job to do, beyond just earning themselves rewards and mining fees. Where does that leave us? Well, the future of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining is anything but certain, as the wild swings in the cryptocurrency’s value suggest. But it seems likely in the near future, at least, that mining will continue as it has done for the past decade. Ever expanding, growing ever more difficult. What that means for Bitcoin’s value and  by the demands of such an expansive network of ASIC hardware, remains to be seen. The future of Blockchain technology, though, is arguably far more exciting. Although we wouldn’t suggest mining Bitcoin, if you’d like to learn more about how to do it, .",

    "title": "Heatmine Eliminates Wasteful CryptoMining By Swapping Space For Heat | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Some argue cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the future of legal tender, but in the present, they’re creating as many problems as they solve. The sheer amount of computational resources required to process blockchain transactions, and release new amounts of these currencies, requires . Just like any electronic device, these heavily customized computers also produce heat — lots of heat. Any person, or company, that wants to mine cryptocurrency on a large scale, will eventually have to deal with the costs associated with both , and the . , a crypto mining start-up based in Quebec, thinks it has found a way to address them both, while benefiting other businesses at the same time. The Heatmine concept, on its face, is brilliantly simple: If mining creates unwanted waste heat, put the miners where that heat can be used. If the electricity and location costs associated with mining are too expensive, put the miners somewhere where electricity is cheap and the location is free. Heatmine’s key insight was that you could satisfy both of these conditions with one device — a crypto mining-powered hot water system, designed to heat a building while it churns out crypto coins. That device resembles something you’d expect to find in an industrial setting: A 1.5 square-meter metal cabinet, stuffed with a hot water tank, and a huge rack of 63 graphics cards, all of which is interconnected by a maze of PVC and copper piping. For an activity as high-tech as cryptomining, it looks decidedly low-tech. But that’s kind of the point. The plumbing portion of the rig converts the waste heat from the GPUs into hot water, which is then stored in the tank. Once connected to a home’s water lines, it can take over as the source of hot water, whether it’s used for a nice, hot shower, or for radiant heat. Heatmine has managed to sidestep utility rate regulation through its decentralization strategy. Each unit is equipped with a 3G data connection for remote management, and the units themselves are installed outside of a customer’s premises. The cabinet is locked from the outside, which prevents any tampering. Heatmine claims one of its standard units can heat up to 300 square meters (3,229 square feet) of space. While the system could be used , it’s currently targeted toward commercial and industrial applications. So, that’s the waste heat portion of the puzzle solved. But what about the electricity? In Quebec, much of the local power grid is fed by carbon-friendly, 100 percent renewable hydroelectricity, thanks to the province’s abundance of fresh water bodies and the hydro dam opportunities these create. It’s also cheap: The top residential electricity rate is 9.12 cents per kilowatt-hour. By comparison, in the New York-New Jersey area, the  residential rate is , at 20.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. That means the top rate is significantly higher. As low as Quebec’s rates are — they’re actually the lowest in North America — there’s a catch. The province’s sole electricity provider, HydroQuebec, saw an alarming trend toward , likely attracted by the low rates. These firms, like Israeli-owned , were originally encouraged by HydroQuebec, because of their ability to quickly sop-up overages in electricity supply. But soon these operations grew in size, and started to place a heavy load on the grid. The utility responded by  for new crypto-farm businesses, up to 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. Still cheaper than some North American markets, but no longer a competitive advantage, and massively more expensive than the 3 cents per kilowatt-hour available in . Earlier this year, Plattsburg, NY voted in an  on all new crypto mining businesses for similar reasons. Le Caveau’s annual electric heating costs for greenhouse is normally $25,000. With Heatmine, that cost has dropped to zero. Heatmine has managed to sidestep this regulation through its decentralization strategy. By co-locating its rigs at agricultural sites, such as greenhouses, the power they consume is metered at the much lower farm rate, which happens to be the same as the residential rate. The remaining question is, how do you get commercial properties to agree to the somewhat invasive presence of a Heatmine rig? What’s in it for them? Plenty, as it turns out. The benefits to Heatmine in terms of cost-savings on electricity, and waste heat management, are so significant, the company is willing to cover 100 percent of the cost of the co-location. This includes the rig itself, the installation costs, and the electricity consumed by the rig. The commercial property gets no interest in the revenue associated with the crypto mining operation, but it does get all of the resulting waste heat for free. For some businesses, the savings could have a material impact on financial performance. Le Caveau à Légumes, a Quebec-based greenhouse grower of strawberries, is amongst the first of Heatmine’s customers. Its president, Guy Béland, tells Digital Trends having a Heatmine system, “enables us to be competitive against produce coming from Mexico and the U.S., as it greatly reduces our overhead.” Béland isn’t exaggerating. Le Caveau’s annual electric heating costs for its 2,100 square foot greenhouse is normally $25,000. With Heatmine, that cost has dropped to zero. “The installation took a total of three days,” Béland said. “The system connects to our existing solution: A heated floor and radiators. As a result, we did not have to make any compromises.” “Our goal is to decentralize one million GPUs over the next five years” Admittedly, it’s early days still. Le Caveau’s system was only installed in September and has yet to face a truly harsh Canadian winter. “The unknown is a little scary,” Béland admits, “as I am unsure of what to expect in the long run.” Béland’s unease could be justified. Heatmine’s current business model of paying all of the associated costs could come under fire if the current  values continues. As of the writing of this article, Bitcoin’s value stands at below $4,000, a decline of nearly $15,000 in value since late 2017. Indeed, 2018 now stands as a stark reminder of just how  cryptocurrencies can be. A lengthy downturn could force Heatmine to underwrite a smaller portion of the electrical bill associated with the operation of its miners. Though this would still offer customers a discount on their heating bills (and a more environmentally responsible way of dealing with waste heat), but it could also introduce a level of unpredictability in customers’ monthly operating expenses. Nonetheless, Heatmine expects a strong interest in its offering. “Our goal is to decentralize one million GPUs over the next five years,” Heatmine COO, Jeremy Dahan tells Digital Trends. To get there, the company will have to target more than just the province’s greenhouses. “In Quebec, there are a lot of factories,” Dahan said, “with big doors that open 20 or more times per day for truck access. They lose a lot of heat.” Once Heatmine has a foothold with these commercial and industrial clients, residential installations are on the company’s roadmap. Dahan claims homeowners could save $6,000 per year in home heating costs with a Heatmine rig. The benefits are clear, but there a few drawbacks. Heating water using waste GPU heat — while very environmentally friendly compared to not using the waste heat — isn’t as efficient as heating water using a dedicated electric hot water tank. Based on numbers provided by Heatmine and Le Caveau à Légumes, we estimate that using Heatmine’s rigs is 17 percent more expensive than using a conventional heating system. But perhaps the bigger issue is the environmental cost of crypto mining as a whole. Electricity consumption is just one part of the equation. Mining, even when done using Heatmine’s decentralized method, is still a voracious consumer of the natural resources needed to produce the graphics cards and related equipment. That feels even more unnecessary when you consider cryptocurrencies’ sinking profit margins. When it comes down to it, mining remains a questionable and unreliable activity. Heatmine may have found a way to avoid much of the excess electrical demand, but it’ll take wide adoption to save the poor reputation cryptocurrency has earned itself over the past year.",

It even has its own application to make the process simple to set up. It’s called  and it runs and accrues as much as 500 Razer Silver in a day. Unfortunately, it’s not worth it. “Razer SoftMiner is the mining reward software that lets you earn Razer Silver when your PC is idle or when you are [away from your keyboard],”  reads. “Razer SoftMiner desktop application utilizes your idle GPU processing power to supplement distributed network needs for the mining process. You will be rewarded with Razer Silver, which varies depending on the amount of idle time and strength of your hardware or .” That may sound all well and good, but as with , you need to look at the economics of what you’re taking part in. Razer suggests you can earn upwards of 500 Razer Silver per day with a powerful graphics card churning away when you aren’t gaming. To buy a , a $50 , you’d need 51,000 Razer Silver, meaning you’d need to run the SoftMiner application for more than 100 days. That’s a big investment in time, but also in money. Your system will be pulling a lot more power than it would be if it was idling or turned off, which is going to increase your electricity bill. Consider, too, that when the SoftMiner is running, your ability to play games will be affected. Your GPU will not be able to render games as well as it would if you weren’t running the software, if it can at all. The load you’re putting on the hardware will also shorten its lifespan, though by how much is difficult to say. Unfortunately, buying mid-level hardware with the Razer Silver you earn will be about the best you can hope for, because, , Razer only lets you use your Silver within a year of earning it. Good luck trying to pay for something that would take you more than a year of mining to accrue enough Silver for. You should also be aware that the reason Razer is giving away Silver is because it’s keeping whatever cryptocurrency you’re mining. It doesn’t state what it’s mining, but you can bet it’s worth more than the Silver you’re given in return. Why not just  instead?",

    "detailContent": " So you’ve taught your 6-year-old child to read, write, and play nice with others. What’s next? Give them a base understanding of cryptocurrency, of course. After all, what self-respecting modern kid trusts their parents to hand over regular installments of allowance without systematically recording it on the blockchain for posterity? Okay, so we’re not quite at the point just yet where Bitcoin joins Little League and  as things that young people go crazy over, but that’s not stopping the folks behind an intriguing new Kickstarter campaign. Called Pigzbe, it’s a smart wallet for youngsters that’s intended to teach your offspring about money and saving for a world that’s rapidly becoming free from the kind of physical money that we grew up with. “It all started with my son, Alex, who’s five years-old,” Filippo Yacob, co-founder and CEO of Pigzbe, told Digital Trends. “One afternoon last year, I was watching him Skype to his granddad. Granddad, who’s also my dad, lives in Italy, and he was showing a coin to the camera and saying, ‘Your mum told me you’ve been a good boy! When I come to see you next month, I’ll bring this to you so you can save it in your piggy bank.’” Yacob, who comes from an ed-tech background, said this got him thinking about how a world in which we can share pictures, videos, text, and recordings across continents should also make it easy to do the same thing with kids’ allowances. The currency which Pigzbe trades is called Wollo, and essentially acts like an easy entry point into the world of cryptocurrency. An associated app lets parents set up standing orders, transfer funds linked to chores, and more. The app also visualizes savings in a lively, fun way, which should hopefully make the process of saving cash seem less abstract. Blurring the line between old-fashioned piggy banks and the cashless digital world is a pink physical wallet, which beeps and lights up when transfers are made. “I wanted to make learning about money relevant in the context of a digital world, but without losing the physicality of the traditional piggy bank,” Yacob explained. Importantly, the money can be transferred back into ordinary currency for spending, although there are also plans for partnerships that will let people spend Wollo in an app-based marketplace. As ever, we offer our usual warnings about the potential  (plus the added risk of new cryptocurrencies). However, if you like the idea enough to get involved, head over to the  to put down your hard-earned money. Prices start at $79, with shipping set for June 2019.",

Balina originally thought that blockchain and cryptocurrency were code for buying drugs off of the dark web, and it wasn’t until his friend told him about its real use that he became interested. “I was working for four years at IBM, then a buddy of mine was seeing all the amazing stuff IBM was doing with blockchain and he wanted me to put him in touch with the IBM Blockchain director, and I asked why,” Balina said. “He told me he was a Bitcoin developer and was heavily involved in the blockchain space. He told me he was launching a crypto fund, and that really got me curious and got me thinking because before I thought blockchain and crypto was dark web for buying drugs online … But when he told me this was something you could actually invest in, it got me really curious. It got me to go down this rabbit hole and the rest is history. Now I’m working full-time in this space and left my job last year to go all-in.” What people remember most about Bitcoin in 2018 is that it lost a lot of its  A single Bitcoin was worth nearly $15,000 in early January 2018 and as of December 12, 2018, one Bitcoin is valued at just $3,432.47. Balina said that the drop in Bitcoin worth is due to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implementing new rules and regulations this year. “The SEC has been giving more guidelines to try to protect U.S. investors … they have also been going after exchangers like EtherDelta, which was one of the first decentralized exchanges, meaning that there wasn’t a central person or government really controlling it — it was something that was created for the community,” Balina said. “But even with that being created in a decentralized manner, the SEC was saying that there could still be somebody at fault. So the SEC fined the founder of EtherDelta almost $400,000 … 2018 has been the SEC coming in and cleaning the space, trying to bring more regulation, more compliance, so it’s not total anarchy.” With what seemed like a trying year for cryptocurrency, we wondered what’s in store for 2019? “At the end of February of 2019, the SEC is reviewing an ETF application for cryptocurrencies, meaning that people with 401Ks, larger retail investors, have the ability to purchase an ETF, an Exchange Traded Fund. [This means] as opposed to buying one particular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, they can just buy an Index Fund that holds multiple cryptocurrencies and have that be the main exposure to crypto. The SEC has been pushing back this deadline — it was actually supposed to be this year … in my opinion, this could really be a catalyst for a new bull run in 2019.” We also wanted to know what he looks for when he is making an investment. “Before investing in anything, we go through the actual technology … I look for all-star teams, people who actually have experience or worked for publicly traded companies … The last thing I look at is the token metrics, how much money they are raising, how much tokens they are creating, meaning what’s the supplier of the token.,” he said.

    "title": "Cryptojacking Malware Now Infects More Than 415,000 Routers Globally | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " A new report suggests that more than 415,000 routers globally could be affected by a malware that allows hackers to steal the computing power of connected PCs to mine for cryptocurrency in a scheme known as . The number of affected routers has more than doubled since the malware was initially discovered in August. At the time, it was reported that around 200,000 routers were affected. Even though the malware threat is expanding, it only affects users who use  routers. “It is worth pointing out that the number of breached devices might be slightly off, since the data reflects IP addresses known to have been infected with cryptojacking scripts,”  reported. “Still, the total amount of compromised routers is still pretty high.” Most of the initially compromised routers were concentrated in Brazil, but as the infection threat expanded, we’re seeing that routers in North America, South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia have also been affected since August, according to a new threat detection map. MikroTik routers are largely sold to internet service providers and organizations, and the surge in router infections shows that not many organizations had installed the latest router firmware. By exploiting a security flaw in older versions of the router’s firmware, the attacker was able to inject Coinhive script onto every web page that a user visits. “MikroTik RouterOS through 6.42 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files and remote authenticated attackers to write arbitrary files due to a directory traversal vulnerability in the WinBox interface,” the  said of the flaw behind MiktroTik’s firmware. Though Coinhive was initially conceived as legitimate software to allow  a visitor’s hardware to mine for Monero, abuse of the script has led many antivirus software to block Coinhive. However, the good news is that a patch was made ready within a day of discovery to rid affected routers of the cryptojacking malware. Security experts recommend that users of MikroTik routers download the  from the company’s website to stay ahead of the malware. Although the cryptocurrency bubble has burst, leading to an excess of  that were stockpiled during the height of the crypto boom, cryptojacking remains a serious security threat. In a separate incident last month, Nova Scotia’s St. Francis Xavier University in Canada was forced to shut down its entire network after consultation with cybersecurity experts after it was discovered that a hacker had hacked the university’s system to steal computing resources to mine for Bitcoin. Fortunately for cryptojacking attacks, personal information on or transmitted across the network is generally not compromised, unlike the  story from earlier this year. With cryptojacking, the attackers are mainly interested in the computing power that’s connected to the Wi-Fi network to mine for cryptocurrency.",

    "title": "Russian Companies Build Solar Blockchain Drone Boat. Here\u0027s Why | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " A great way of garnering attention (and, hopefully, success) for yourself as an entrepreneur is to latch onto whatever happens to be on the cutting edge of technology at that particular moment. Drones? Sure. Blockchain? You bet. The Internet of Things? Frankly, you’d be silly not to. But even with this behavior being standard practice, few buzzword bingo cards are quite so complete as that of a new Russian project involving a solar-powered drone boat that takes smart sensor readings and saves them to the blockchain. To be fair, the so-called “Drone on the Volga” project actually promises to do some good. The work of companies  and Smart IoT Distributions, the drone boat takes continuous water readings in the Kuybyshev Reservoir, the largest water reservoir in Eurasia, which is located in the Volga river. This data is then made available through the Ethereum blockchain, along with parameters such as exactly where the drone boat was at the time the readings were taken. By analyzing the data, third-party companies can then work to find the source of pollution — hopefully to do something about it. Since Russia holds approximately one-fifth of the world’s freshwater, this is a mission that should be of interest to everyone. “Imagine hundreds of such robots floating autonomously on a river without the need for human support,” Alisher Khassanov, chief engineer at Airalab, told Digital Trends. “Of course, to make this happen, they need an autonomous power source. These are solar photovoltaic panels. Such robots could be a source of a continuous stream of data on river pollution, protected by the blockchain.” This isn’t the first time we’ve written about robot projects which aim to autonomously take water readings to help fight pollution. One of the most interesting of these is the  which patrol the reservoirs in Singapore, taking water quality measurements as they do. This data is made available in real time over the cloud to experts from water management agencies, who can then ensure that water quality problems are addressed quickly. Hopefully, as the dream of smart cities gains momentum, projects like this will only become more commonplace. After all, if there’s one thing we can’t really do without, it’s clean water.",

    "detailContent": " New smartphones usually stand out because of an innovative camera, a super-fast new processor, or another established feature being treated to an update. The  isn’t about any of those things — it’s a phone , and that makes it very unusual. Does this niche appeal hurt it, or is this a phone that will appeal to everyone? The phone’s entire reason for being is cryptocurrency and Blockchain, whether it’s as a cold storage wallet, a device for carrying out transactions, providing high levels of security, or running decentralized applications (DApps). If these things mean nothing to you, then the phone will likely be of little interest. However, regardless of whether you’re embarking on a crypto journey, or an established token collector, the Finney phone will be a compelling device with few competitors. Most intriguing is the Safe Screen, a slide-up mini display at the top of the phone, which activates the cold wallet. It’s used to verify transactions, confirm the recipient’s address and the currency type, all onboard the device. Safety and security is paramount, and the hardware for the cold wallet is separate to the phone’s hardware, uses a Firewall Embedded Rules engine, and only connects to the internet when prompted to do so. Security and privacy was a major part of Sirin Lab’s first phone, , and the Finney runs a version of  8.1 called Sirin OS that’s packed with protection. An Intrusion Prevention System uses machine learning to monitor the phone from the kernel to app level, watching for threats both online and offline, and protects against network and host attacks. Sirin Labs wants to make sure your cryptocurrency remains safe, and it’s actively looking for partners to use Sirin OS on other phones too. The Finney phone has two other features that will appeal to crypto-types. The first is dCENTER, a DApp marketplace, which differs by encouraging partners to offer incentivised educational schemes for owners to, “learn and earn.” The second is the Token Conversion Service (TCS) for easy payments, which includes a market value-based currency exchange. Sirin OS’s algorithms automatically work out the details to provide the fastest speeds at the lowest rates. It supports Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Sirin Lab’s own SRN token at launch. How about the device itself? Sirin Labs is working with Foxconn to produce the Finney phone, which is made from metal and Gorilla Glass, and is powered by a Snapdragon 845 processor and 6GB of . The main screen measures 6 inches and has a 2160 x 1080 pixel resolution, while the cold-storage wallet has a 2-inch screen. On the back of the phone is a 12-megapixel camera with an f/1.8 aperture, and the self camera has 8 megapixels and an f/2.2 aperture. The Finney connects to GSM and CDMA networks, has  and Bluetooth 5.0, a 3,280mAh battery, and a fingerprint sensor. While Sirin Labs is convinced the , at first it’s definitely only for the crypto-hardcore. To buy the $1,000 device now, you have to do so using Sirin Lab’s own SRN token through its website. Those who do so will get the phone first. In January, the Finney will also be available on Amazon Launchpad, when ordinary people with credit cards will be able to buy one. For those who’re curious but unsure, Sirin Labs will open two retail stores — one in London and the other in Tokyo — that will not only sell the phone, but also run educational courses on the Blockchain to get people started. The big question is, will ordinary people have any interest? Probably not, given how dense and complex the underlying technology is. But there is a massive cryptocurrency community that could flock to it, and with only  for competition right now, Sirin Labs has a chance to capitalize on the cryptocurrency excitement with the Finney.",

There has been lots of speculation over the years regarding Sony’s next-generation gaming console. While a new and improved PlayStation system seems inevitable, the specifics of it aren’t clear. However, according to a Reddit user, an announcement for the PlayStation 5 is set to be unveiled in 2019, with a release date of either March or November 2020. While it might seem a bit strange to put so much stock into something a rando on the internet said, RuthenicCookie already correctly claimed that Sony would not be attending the next E3, which . That, coupled with the fact that 2020 would mark the seventh year since the launch of the PlayStation 4, actually makes some sense. We also discussed the future of warehouse automation, particularly in regards to grocery store giant Kroger. In an effort to better compete with companies like Amazon and Walmart, Kroger has partnered with U.K.-based Ocado Group PLC to create a robotic warehouse in Cincinnati. With more than 20 high-tech facilities slated to open in the next few years, the company’s newest machines — which can put together a 50-item grocery list in as little as five minutes — is making strides to potentially slash labor costs and find new ways to get products directly to customer’s doorsteps. Another company pushing the boundaries of existing technology is Microsoft, with its latest artificial intelligence project,  (pronounced “Shao-ice”). What makes Xiaoice different from existing virtual assistants like Siri or  is that it aims to anticipate your needs and requests rather than answer basic questions. We also sat down with the CEO and founder of Blockchain Development Eric Lamison-White to discuss how he received a patent for Stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that aims to overcome the volatility of the industry.

    "title": "Stablecoin Expert Eric Lamison-White Discusses All Things Cryptocurrency | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Today on Digital Trends Live, we brought on cryptocurrency expert Eric Lamison-White to help us understand and the ecosystem it lives within. ‘s quick definition of Bitcoin is “a form of peer-to-peer electronic cash.” His role within the Bitcoin world is running a market insight platform, called , that uses primarily to drive how information about Bitcoin is curated. He got involved with Bitcoin back in 2011, when he was working for a company that was trying to build a mobile wallet. When Bitcoin’s wallet came out ,it did exactly what his company was attempting, so he decided he would become an expert in everything cryptocurrency. He now has a patent for Stablecoin, which helps Bitcoin not seem so volatile. “The Stablecoin is a way to stay inside the crypto ecosystem, but still have stable value. Usually, it’s a parallel digital asset that is tied to a U.S. dollar or something like that. … People don’t have to cash out, they can stay in and continue commerce, as well as being well-positioned to speculate what they want without having to deal with bank transfers and delays.”  says there are currently 50 different Stablecoin projects out there. “A lot of founders are consolidating a lot of capital, getting a lot of funding to launch these Stablecoins,” he said, adding that consumers haven’t yet caught on to the value of this new form of protection. He explains the patent “parallel asset that people move their money into — this implementation doesn’t pull value away from the actual cryptocurrency.” Since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency have seen some recent , we asked how he sees the future panning out and what people should do. “With Bitcoin and cryptocurrancy,” he said, “you have people buying them for this infinite price improvement, as if it was their chance to get in on a low-price stock, but that is the wrong approach to this economy. With that in mind, in the near term,there are compelling reasons for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency’s prices to be a lot lower. In the longer term, as all this infrastructure improves, you’ll see a lot more money pouring into or meeting public resource, and that just makes it more scacre, which usually means higher prices.” With Pareto Network, he is heavily focused on cryptocurrency and looking at it from a more holistic point of view to help people understand what they are truly putting their money into and how it will work for them in the future.

The aim is for the startup to develop games for the PC, console, and mobile markets and to capitalize on the success of games like  which has been taking over the gaming world. With huge numbers of users logging on to play the multiplayer survival game, the market is ripe for new gaming technologies — or so Mythical Games hopes. The advantage of blockchain for gaming is primarily in the tracking of trades of in-game items. Currently, many online games have official or unofficial markets for rare items where players swap items, buy items with in-game currency, or even buy items using real money. The problem is that many games have rules against trading in-game items for real money, even if the behavior is common, and the money involved can lead to . Through the use of the blockchain, it is possible to track exactly which items have been made available to which players and how they have been traded or passed around since then. If you spend money on an in-game item, you want to be sure that it was come by legitimately and that you won’t be suspended or booted from the game for having it. With its ability to supply proof of acquisition and proof of ownership, blockchain could make the trading of items safer and less illicit. Another issue is the buying and selling of entire accounts, which has been a particular problem in . Although this behavior is against the rules of the game, people still engage in it. And according to the developers Epic Games, the practice of selling accounts has lead to  and a variety of  against players. With the use of blockchain, players can easily prove that an account is theirs and that they earned their items and levels, and stolen accounts will be easier to spot and to return to their rightful owners.

    "detailContent": " Before really studying the pictures of the  watch here, ask yourself just how geeky you are. Then ask yourself how rich you are. If the answer to both these questions is, “Very,” then you can not only stare in adoration; but also consider actually buying one. The watch is a celebration of , and has various design elements inspired by cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology, but the real geeky kicker is that it can only be purchased using Bitcoin. None of your old-world cash or credit cards will be accepted, thanks. That’s the tech side covered, how about the price? Your crypto-wallet will need to have the equivalent of $25,000 to secure one. Even if you have the money, getting one will still be a challenge, as production is limited to 210 models — a reference to the maximum global limit of 21 million Bitcoins — and currently Hublot describes the pre-order phase as “over-subscribed.” It still suggests you sign-up though, and it may be worth it. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency means those who have $25,000 today, may only have $25 when the day comes to pay up. Perhaps the coolest part of the design will be the engraved transaction number on the bezel’s edge, making each watch unique, totally individual to the buyer, and easily identifiable. The Bitcoin logo can be seen on parts of the skeleton HUB1201 movement, which has a power reserve of 10 days, another reference to Bitcoin’s 10th anniversary. The rubber and calf leather strap has an embossed design made to recall the Blockchain, networks, and interconnected computers. The beautiful 45mm handmade case is made from micro-blasted and polished ceramic, the glass is anti-reflective sapphire with the Hublot logo on the underside, and the sapphire on the case back has a world map engraved on it. It’s water resistant to 100 meters, and comes only in the stunning black PVD titanium and blue seen in the images. Hublot has partnered with digital asset brokerage house OSL on the sale of the Big Bang Meca-10 P2P. Pre-registration is still open , with the caveat that all models are currently sold, and deliveries are expected to begin on January 3, 2019.

    "title": "Why Amazon and Other Tech Companies May Be Poised to Upend Spotify | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The music industry was recently buzzing with Amazon’s announcement that it plans to kick off its first national TV campaign for its music streaming service – Amazon Music Unlimited. While the company already has “tens of millions of users,” increased marketing dollars will be sure to score Amazon even more – at least some of whom could jump ship from industry leaders like Spotify and Apple Music in the hopes of scoring a cheaper monthly price for an all-you-can-eat buffet of streamed music. This campaign push from Amazon begs an important question. Knowing that it’s widely documented that streaming has resulted in , why is the e-Commerce giant putting money behind an unprofitable business? Peer behind the curtain and it’s a simple answer really: like Apple, Amazon’s primary business model is not making money off music — its instead focused on retail, logistics, web services, and . However, building a competitive product works to support its other business needs, even if its music service ends up being a loss-leader. At the end of the day, all Amazon really wants is to make sure people are using Prime services, and by tying its streaming music service to Prime, it’s doing exactly that. While Amazon and Apple can both afford to gamble with unlimited streaming, it’s companies like Spotify — whose main source of revenue is based on the unlimited streaming model – that should be concerned. Despite the continued dominance of streaming among consumers  in 2017 according to RIAA), the streaming model looks unsustainable for any company where music is the primary revenue source. Case in point: Spotify’s recent quarterly earnings — which revealed that it  over the past 12 months. The streaming model looks unsustainable for any company where music is the primary revenue source. For streamers like Spotify, a rolling debt to major label shareholders represents a significant hurdle on the road to profitability. Why? The cost of royalties that providers pay to labels is far too high. Spotify’s recent label licensing negotiations — bringing its label payout from a whopping 88 percent to 77 percent — along with direct licensing deals with a small number of independent artists who can now upload their music directly to the platform, are strong signals that the business can’t sustain the payout levels to the big labels. It’s not just streaming providers and their bottom lines that are hurting, but also the artists that fuel their playlists. A real and growing frustration is occurring among artists over the dwindling streaming profits they’re receiving — even though paid subscribers are spending upwards of $120 a year on streaming music services, as opposed to an . In just one example that echoes the experience of many, Musician Peter Frampton announced that he had made  of his song . Unfortunately, it’s not expected to get any better. As more consumers flock to “all you can eat” unlimited streaming options, artists are getting fewer dollars for more streams. In an industry driven by streaming subscriptions, certain parties (ie. labels and publishers) are guaranteed revenues while others — specifically the artists — are not. Artists, musicians and songwriters are left to pick up what’s left after everyone else takes their cut — which isn’t much. This, coupled with the fact that the top artists continue to get most of the streams, leaves the majority of artists and musicians scrambling to make any meaningful and sustainable income from their songs. Of the 377 billion streams in 2017, . That’s not by accident; big labels are funneling major marketing dollars to showcase their top artists on Spotify and Amazon’s “featured” playlists — leaving indie artists unpromoted and essentially, unpaid. Another unfortunate result of unlimited streaming’s unsustainable model is that for artists, making a living depends more and more on touring and gigs. These days, the reality remains that most of the money artists make comes from live performances and merchandise, causing many musicians to either live a life on the road or skip out altogether and find their income from another source. In the current system, unless service providers have alternative sources of revenue to prop up a music streaming service – e.g., Apple, Google and Amazon — or are prepared to lean heavily on payola practices, they’re facing an uphill battle of declining profits. Add this to the fact that the majority of the industry’s artists and musicians are accepting pennies on the dollars for their streams and it’s clear: Things must change. There are solutions, though whether or not they are viable ones in the current music streaming landscape remains in question. At its very core, blockchain offers a transparent, decentralized way for goods, files, and currency to be exchanged. In order to survive, service providers must reconsider the unlimited and even single-price model. Simply put, it’s not sustainable in a fixed cost environment — both for themselves and the artists that they work with. In the future, there won’t be enough new, paying users to supplement the growing number of streams, further lowering the amount made per stream and average revenue per user. One solution is a pay as you go model, where heavy listeners pay more than those who only stream a handful of songs every month. Just as important, a real and lasting adjustment needs to be made of the split of the theoretical profit pie that’s traditionally been divvied up between labels, streaming providers, distributors and musicians and artists. While artists themselves must demand that they take home more money per stream, the industry as a whole must be open to the benefits that new technological innovations can provide. One of those advancements comes in the form of blockchain. At its very core, blockchain offers a transparent, decentralized way for goods, files, and currency to be exchanged. How does that work in the music industry? Blockchain can put the power back into the hands of artists through the use of smart contracts. Using smart contracts, every interaction with a song or album — from upload to purchase and stream — is documented within the blockchain, giving artists full visibility into rights and rewards associated with their music. Artists and labels will be able to better view, track, and manage music royalties and data, providing quicker access to funds and the flexibility to redistribute rights. While innovations like blockchain aren’t a sure-fire saving grace to the challenges that streaming faces, it’s one tool that streaming providers and artists alike should consider if they want a lasting, efficient and viable model for selling and streaming music. If not, the industry may see providers like Spotify fall to titans like Amazon that can afford to “lose” and ultimately, fans may be forced to spend more money on the music they crave.",

    "title": "10 years of Bitcoin: How a geeky cryptocurrency changed the world | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Happy birthday, ! From its birth 10 years ago, Bitcoin has grown from fledgling cryptocurrency proof-of-concept into a real world cash alternative that’s taken seriously by everyone from economists to technologists to national governments. In the process, it’s helped spark the launch of 2,000 more cryptocurrencies, achieved a record high of nearly $20,000 per coin, and much, much more. Here are some of the highs and lows of the world’s most famous cryptocurrency since its creation in 2008. Bitcoin didn’t technically begin trading until January 2009, so why are we celebrating its birthday today? Simple: Because this marks the day that a mysterious person named Satoshi Nakamoto (think ’ Keyser Söze with more of an interest in cryptocurrency) posted a paper titled, “” on an online cryptography mailing list. Until this point, there had been discussion of similar ideas (including by the NSA, who published a 1996 paper titled “.”) However, no-one had implemented the idea successfully. Satoshi Nakamoto helped change all that. Bitcoin began in earnest in January when the Bitcoin network was officially created. No Bitcoin exchanges existed initially, meaning that there was no way of accurately gauging the value of an individual Bitcoin. However, early adopters were able to start mining for the coins, and their ownership was recorded and verified on the blockchain. The recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction was programmer Hal Finney, who received 10 Bitcoins from Satoshi Nakamoto. With a finite supply of 21 million Bitcoins, the currency was off to the races! In February, the world’s first Bitcoin currency exchange — the now defunct BitcoinMarkets.com — was established. It included automated and escrow trading, assorted payment options, trader ratings, and a private messaging system. It helped establish the growing Bitcoin community. That same year, Bitcoin entered the real world, too, as early adopter Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC in Florida. Meanwhile, in November, Slush’s Pool became the first  pool. It allowed groups of Bitcoin miners to team up to mine coins, and then split the reward according to each person’s contribution. Oh yes, and the total value of all available Bitcoin passed $1 million! This year was all about milestones — and competition. In February, the price for a single Bitcoin drew even with that of a single U.S. dollar. A few months later, the value of a single Bitcoin equalled that of European currency, the euro. These landmark events caused a surge of interest in the new cryptocurrency. Rival coins started to appear, too, such as Namecoin and Litecoin. Not everything was good for the world of cryptocurrencies, though. Days after hitting a peak of $31.91 in value, Bitcoin crashed down to just $10. It underscored just how much volatility existed in the Bitcoin market during its earliest days. In May, an , in which the Feds voice their concerns that Bitcoin could be used as a payment method for illegal transactions involving weapons and drugs. Combined with the rise of the Silk Road, the first modern darknet marketplace, it added up to a bunch of negative publicity for Bitcoin. Things weren’t helped by various hacks of Bitcoin exchanges and other sites which use the technology. Cloud services provider Linode fell prey to a massive hack in which 46,703 BTC were stolen. At the time, these carried a value of around $228,000. Today, that would be upwards of $286.7 million. It wasn’t the first time that similar Bitcoin thefts took place, although this was among the biggest. In February, Bitcoin’s value passed $30 per coin again for the first time in two years. After that, it keeps right on climbing. By March, the total value of Bitcoin in circulation exceeded $1 billion. By November, the value of a single Bitcoin was $503, representing a major new record. It quickly doubled to $1,000 before dropping back down. Bitcoin didn’t rise back to four figures until 2017. The biggest news of the year happened right up front — as the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt.Gox, went offline. By 2014 Mt.Gox was handling around 70 percent of all the world’s Bitcoin transactions. Suddenly, the 850,000 Bitcoins on the exchange vanished without trace, with someone getting away with a haul of Bitcoin valued at $450 million dollars at the time. Today, that treasure trove of illicit coins would have a value of more than $4 billion. Prior to closing up shop, customers had been growing increasingly upset with the long delays withdrawing cash from their accounts on Mt.Gox. Some people even reported waiting months to remove their money. As it turned out, they were the fortunate ones! After a fairly uneventful 2015 (so quiet, in fact, that we skipped it entirely in this article), 2016 marked the further mainstreaming of Bitcoin around the world. In March, Japan officially recognized virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, as being a recognized currency just like cash money. Elsewhere, Steam added to the number of platforms embracing Bitcoin as a payment method by allowing customers to use it to pay for video games and online media. The number of dedicated ATMs allowing users to trade the cryptocurrency doubled to 771 around the world. Finally,  — the first academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrencies — published its first edition. As busy a year as that sounded, in retrospect this was the calm before the (insanely profitable) storm. In 2017, Bitcoin’s value went through the roof. Over the year, the value of a single Bitcoin rose from approximately $1,000 on New Year’s Day to nearly $20,000 by December. In short, this was a monster annum for Bitcoin — and everyone who had faith in it. In other happenings, the Bitcoin symbol was officially encoded as a character in Unicode version 10.0, while Bitcoin split into two derivative currencies — the BTC Bitcoin chain and the BCH Bitcoin Cash chain. This event was called the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. Make no mistake: 2017 was the year in which everyone, including major financial institutions, went cryptocurrency mad. After a monster year like 2017, where was there for Bitcoin to go but down? Between January 26 and February 6, the price of the currency halved, eventually falling to $6,000 per coin. While enormous strides have been made in the past decade, it’s a reminder that cryptocurrencies remain volatile. By now, the model has been proven and we’re no longer living in a Bitcoin Wild West as we were a few years back. But there’s still risk attached. Where will things go over the next 10 years? We’re excited to find out!",

    "detailContent": " Bitcoin celebrates its 10th birthday today, which is a major milestone for a technology that some skeptical pundits predicted would never make it out of single digits. However, while there is plenty to love about the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, people have also raised concerns about what the heavy hardware requirements of Bitcoin mining mean for our planet. Bitcoin mining requires massive amounts of electricity, which means enormous amounts of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere as a result. In 2017 alone, the use of Bitcoin resulted in an estimated 69 million metric tons of CO2 emission. But what does this mean in terms of climate change? Nothing good, unfortunately. According to a new study coming out of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, provided that Bitcoin continues its trajectory it could produce enough emissions to raise global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius as soon as 2033. This holds true if Bitcoin is adopted at even the lowest rate at which other technologies have been incorporated. For their study, the researchers examined the power efficiency of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), the computers currently in use for . They then factored in the locations where Bitcoin is likely computed and the corresponding CO2 emissions, based on the electricity production fuels in those countries. Needless to say, this is bad news — since increased climate change oft 2 degrees Celsius could push the planet’s temperature increase past the 1.5 Celsius threshold . “We are not aiming to predict the future of Bitcoin, but rather we hope that this research highlights the importance of considering the potential environmental impacts of emerging technologies in terms of CO2 emissions and climate change,” Katie Taladay, one of the researchers on the project, told Digital Trends. “It is essential that emerging technologies like Bitcoin are developed and adopted with energy efficiency in mind.” Randi Rollins, another researcher involved in the study, said that, while Bitcoin is an “innovative and interesting” technology, something will need to change with the way that coins are currently mined. “Bitcoin highlights a broader issue: Emerging technologies and industries need to take their potential footprint into consideration, and make smart decisions for development, being aware of the consequences of emission production,” Rollins said. “Green, sustainable energy would allow Bitcoin to continue, as is, without the repercussions we outline in our paper.” Fortunately, it seems that there are a growing number of efforts to . Will this be enough to help slow the kind of climate change this study predicts? Provided these researchers are correct, we certainly hope so. A paper describing this work was .",

    "title": "What Is a Blockchain Phone? We Asked an Expert | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Few technologies have attracted the frenzied level of  that has surrounded blockchain over the last couple of years, but the technology is not well understood. Advocates often argue that blockchain goes way beyond cryptocurrency, even though the two are inextricably linked in the public consciousness, but deeper conversations about blockchain typically have a heavy focus on potential. With  going up for preorder, joining blockchain phones from lesser known names like  and Sikur, we wanted to try and find out what a blockchain phone is, and who might want one? What can it do? And why are companies making them now? “It’s about the internet, where it’s going, and what’s wrong with it right now,” Phil Chen, decentralized chief officer at HTC, told Digital Trends. “Our position is that there’s something deeply wrong right now because people don’t own their digital identities; they don’t own their digital data; they don’t own their personal data. Whether it’s behavioral data, commercial data, health data, browsing data, or something else, all of that is owned by a handful of companies.” We use ostensibly free services from the likes of Google and Facebook with some understanding that they’re not really free — we are trading our data in return for those services. It’s clear that companies with enormous, centralized data hoards are finding ways to monetize that information. In fact, their business models are based on selling insights and targeted advertising. “It’s about the internet, where it’s going, and what’s wrong with it right now.” “I find it quite frightening to think that we’re this far into the information age and there’s no concept of digital property,” Chen said. “If you think about the agricultural revolution with real estate property, and the industrial revolution with intellectual property, and we’ve gone this far into the information age and still people don’t think their data is worth anything.” There’s a growing swell of opinion that’s coming around to the idea that we may have sold ourselves short in giving away all our data. Whether it was an agreement we entered into with open eyes is debatable, and where we go from here is far from clear. But what does all this have to do with a blockchain phone? We’ve looked at  before. In brief, it’s an immutable, decentralized ledger. The ledger is a list of transactions, or blocks, that are distributed across a network of different devices, or nodes, instead of being held on a central server. Every user has a private key and a public key which they can use together like a digital signature to create a new block. Each block is verified by the network and then added to the chain. Once added, it cannot be altered. The HTC Exodus 1 is an Android phone with a secure enclave that allows you to keep possession of your own keys, and potentially your own data, instead of Google, Apple, an exchange, or some other company holding them for you. It’s effectively an Android phone like any other with all the same functionality, but it has this additional locked area that’s protected from . “What we’ve built is like a parallel micro operating system that’s secure,” Chen said. “So, for certain secure transactions, in this case holding your private keys and signing transactions in the crypto space, you use that secure enclave.” The first application of this is to allow you to hold cryptocurrency or other crypto assets like non-fungible tokens securely, but Chen sees it as the foundation of being able to own and hold your own digital identity and data. To properly explain one of the potential applications for this kind of technology we’re going to talk about CryptoKitties. Yes, you read that right, bear with us. “It’s very significant what CryptoKitties have done because it has completely changed the idea of what digital content is,” Chen said. “The concept of non-fungible tokens builds on this idea of digital scarcity.” CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based game where people can breed, trade, and sell digital cats. The key thing to understand here is that each cat is genuinely unique and can’t be copied, which led to one cat, named Dragon, . Blockchain was originally conceived as a way to prevent double-spending of bitcoin. In simple terms, when I give you a bitcoin, I don’t have it anymore. That’s not usually the case with digital files, because it’s easy to copy a file so that we both have the same file. “That technology empowered Steve Jobs to disrupt the whole music industry with the iPod and iTunes” “That technology empowered Steve Jobs to disrupt the whole music industry with the iPod and iTunes,” Chen said. “Non-fungible tokens are building on top of this immutable power of the blockchain, so you can’t copy digital content anymore.” It potentially gives some intrinsic value or worth back to digital content and it could be applied to a song, a video, or something else just as easily as a digital cat. There’s clearly a big , especially around digital loot, but there’s no reason it can’t spread beyond that. “We see it as a completely new paradigm,” Chen said. “Right now, it’s wallet exchanges and gaming collectibles, but we don’t know what killer apps will come out of this.” The obvious question that crops up in any discussion of a blockchain phone is what happens if I lose my phone or it gets stolen? Your keys, and possibly eventually your digital data, are physically stored on that device. The HTC Exodus 1 isn’t a cold storage device like Sirin Labs’ Finney blockchain phone, which can also keep your digital currency safely stowed and disconnected from the internet. “I think demand for cryptocurrency-enabled phones is going to be limited to enthusiasts for the near term, especially devices that have cold storage components to them,” Scotty Perkins,  senior vice president for Product Innovation, told Digital Trends. “If you have coin holdings in cold storage electronically on your mobile phone, you really have to think carefully about what happens if the phone is lost, stolen, or irreparably damaged. Unless you plan carefully, you can lose much more than just the value of the phone and a few contacts.” HTC has gone for a kind of middle ground, limiting the risk of centralized wealth, but stopping short of completely isolated cold storage. “There’s no such thing as 100 percent security, there’s always a balance between security and usability,” Chen said. “Right now, all your wealth is online, stored in some centralized server. We are at least spreading the risk with blockchain phones, there’s no one failure point that gives you access to digitally rob 150 million people; if you want to rob someone you have to physically rob them.” So, what if you do get robbed or you lose your blockchain phone? With a normal phone you can call Google or Apple and run through a recovery process to get the keys to your account back, which will at least restore the data you backed up. With the decentralized blockchain you have no such recourse, which is why HTC has come up with something it calls Social Key Recovery. Employing a well-known algorithm for sharing, the mechanism splits your key into five different parts, so you can share it among your family and close friends. When you lose your phone, you can call up three out of the five friends to recover it. Because it’s strictly for recovery, you still need your biometrics or password, so they can’t get together behind your back to access your key and start signing transactions. With cold storage, you need to recover the device, or the assets stored on it are gone forever. Chen has no illusions about the market for the HTC Exodus 1 today. This is the beginning of something new and no one really knows where it will lead. “Right now, it’s targeted towards the crypto crowd that really understands what it means to hold your own private keys,” Chen explains “Which is, in fact, not even the majority of crypto users.” This is the beginning of something new and no one really knows where it will lead. HTC is looking for help to make the device and system more secure. The plan is to release Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) so third-party developers can use the Exodus 1 to protect keys and sign transactions. There’s no telling what kind of decentralized apps and services might come from this. The potential of blockchain is undeniably exciting; it could fundamentally change the way we interact with the internet, but you’ve probably heard that before and there are plenty of powerful players with a vested interest in the status quo. For now, blockchain phones are about managing cryptocurrency and some other digital assets. Whether they ever grow beyond that depends on whether blockchain can fulfil that potential. That’s simply impossible to predict right now, but HTC is far from the only player betting that it will.",

    "detailContent": " A rumored new deal with banks that would use the  to speed up and ease international transactions has sent the value of the altcoin skyrocketing. In the past 24 hours alone, XRP has jumped in value some 70 percent, rising to its highest peak in 2018. At the time of this writing, XRP sits at $0.62 per token, which might not seem like a lot when you consider that . However, this represents a stark rise from just 24 hours ago, where it was worth just $0.36 per XRP. The rise in value was pushed by a new wave of excitement over the alternative cryptocurrency which even made it the most traded of any cryptocurrency throughout the past 24-hour period, with some $2.2 billion of it changing hands. This is due to the announcement by  Sagar Sarbhai in a chat with . He said that 120 banks were already partnered with Ripple and that the company’s xRapid cryptocurrency product would soon enter commercial application. Although he didn’t give a specific day, he suggested that it would happen within the next month or so. xRapid is designed to give banks a quick and easy way to transfer sums across borders, leading to faster international transactions for their customers, potentially with reduced fees, in theory. The process would see local currencies converted into XRP before being transferred overseas and then converted into that local currency at the other end. No specific financial institutions have been named as potential adoptees of the xRapid system, but with major partnerships with organizations like Santander, American Express, and Western Union, Ripple Labs has plenty of potential customers for its new tool. Ripple use has generated some controversy in cryptocurrency circles since its creation in 2012, though. Unlike Bitcoin and most of its contemporaries, Ripple is centralized, meaning that Ripple Labs controls the majority of the tokens in existence and organizations like banks can have a say in how transactions are conducted. This is diametrically opposed to the decentralized, hands-off model that Bitcoin inspired in its users and  that have been created since.",

    "detailContent": " Unlike traditional mining, cryptocurrency mining doesn’t involve digging huge pits in the ground to remove valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth. But that doesn’t mean there’s no environmental impact. Far from it, in fact. While there’s no definitive number that’s been agreed upon, the mining of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin consumes a  — possibly even as much as a country the size of Ireland. Could a new sustainable approach help? With such an eco-friendly goal in mind, the company  has announced that it is currently developing a $2 billion, 900MW wind farm power plant in one of the windiest regions of Morocco to help power the blockchain in a more eco-friendly and sustainable way. The broad stretch of land will produce power for carrying out high-density computing tasks — including the aforementioned cryptocurrency mining, along with distributed graphics rendering, file storage, and machine learning computation. This has the potential to be one of the world’s largest off-grid cryptocurrency mining operations. “Our flagship location in Dakhla, Morocco is better known as the ‘Kitesurfing Capital of the World,’” John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna, told Digital Trends. “Wind travels at over 23 miles per hour for most the year, making the region one of the best wind locations. Our site is very flat, with no sand dunes, and therefore not much in the way of dust or sandstorms. It is twice the size of Manhattan, or 37,000 acres, across sixty miles.” According to Belizaire, Soluna aims to be the world’s first vertically-integrated blockchain computing company powered by its own green power. This will set it in stark contrast to cryptocurrency miners who have turned to inexpensive but environmentally damaging fossil fuels to power their coin-gathering ambitions. “Our current plan is to start construction of phase one in early 2019 and complete in early-to-mid 2020,” he continued. “We have started soliciting bids from some of the best turbines makers. They are all excited by the prospects of this project.” Will Soluna’s ambitions become a reality? We certainly hope so, especially since a demonstration of sustainable innovation in this area should lead others to follow the company’s example.",

    "detailContent": " The question of how much of your personal data you woul be willing to give up for ostensibly free stuff is what drives the value of some of the world’s biggest tech giants — ranging from Google to Facebook. It’s also a conundrum that is put to the test in the latest creation of coder artist . Dörfelt has built a high-tech camera-equipped vending machine called  (no, not the movie where John Travolta and Nicolas Cage swap faces) which exchanges unique prints of computer-generated faces for users taking a selfie that is then permanently stored in the  blockchain. “My main goal for Face Trade was to create an installation that is odd, surprising, and fun on the surface, while being a comment and experiment on how easily people are willing to give up personal — and in this case even biometric — information in order to receive a ‘free’ artwork,” Dörfelt told Digital Trends. Dörfelt said that the machine-generated faces are generated on the spot by the computer vending machine. They are designed to be intentionally ambiguous with faces that are showing emotions which are not immediately identifiable. “It is not quite clear if the faces are happy, evil, exhausted, or possibly trying to deceive you,” he said. “The drawings are, in a lot of ways, a representation of my feelings towards the short but explosive history of blockchain, which somewhat oscillates between the amazing promises of democratization and decentralization on the one hand, and silk road, greed, and hyper-capitalism on the other end of the spectrum.” The Face Trade vending machine is currently being exhibited at Art Center Nabi in Seoul, South Korea. “Right now, it is running on an Ethereum test network as I consider the current exhibition as more of a test run,” Dörfelt continued. “This means, as of now, the faces are not stored in the main Ethereum blockchain — which I guess is a better deal for the participants. [However], there will be another Blockchain-related show in late November, also at Nabi, where the piece will be shown again. I plan to have things running on the main Ethereum network for that second show.” While projects such as this are certainly fun in their conception (and, hey, who ), there’s no doubt that it taps into our anxieties surrounding a much bigger issue when it comes to privacy and today’s internet titans. Ask yourself: Would you be willing to make this particular trade? There’s a unique algorithmically generated artwork if you would!",

    "detailContent": " There is a new band of digital vigilantes on the loose and they’re going after mining malware. This isn’t a group of individual hackers though, but a botnet that is being leveraged to take out some of the most pernicious crypto-jacking software in the world. Known as Fbot, the botnet scans websites for a specific piece of mining malware and when it finds it, the botnet takes over the nefarious software and then destroys itself, taking the malware with it. Crypto-jacking malware has been on the rise over the past couple of years and it even  for hackers earlier this year. Typically, the malware is installed via a malicious download or infected website and forces the system it’s attached to mine cryptocurrency. Although not as malicious or as damaging as data theft or encrypting a user’s files, it can wear out hardware by forcing it to run faster and harder than it was designed to do. Typical  can help protect against it, but Fbot is going after the source: The sites that distribute this malware in the first place. It specifically targets the crypto-jacking malware known as com.ufo.miner and it’s rather effective at killing it off when it does discover it. As , the Fbot botnet does appear to be linked to a domain name system, but it uses EmerDNS. That blockchain based DNS is entirely decentralized, so tracking down individual domain name owners isn’t easy. As of now, the creators of Fbot remain as unknown as the developers of the crypto-jacking malware it targets, but their efforts appear admirable. The researchers who discovered the botnet, , claim that there appear to be links between this botnet and the Satori botnet which has in the past been used to infect mining hardware. With that in mind, it’s possible that Fbot doesn’t have altruistic aims, but is instead being used to reduce the saturation of the com.ufo.miner in favor of the creator’s own malware. Regardless of motive though, the end result in the short term is that there should be less crypto-jacking malware to be wary of.",

However, this digital money debut isn’t quite so impactful because the Bitcoins that Walmart has priced at just $1 per coin won’t help you make a fortune or buy something illicit on the dark web. These Bitcoins are made of chocolate. Created by Frankford Candy, the chocolate Bitcoins look like every digital rendering of the virtual currency you’ve ever seen, as per . Big, gold-plated, chunky coins. Instead of being metal through and through though, they’re merely wrapped in it.

    "detailContent": " , an Ethereum blockchain-based game that allows users to breed, trade, and sell digital cats, may have scored the most expensive in-app purchase to date with the sale of a CryptoKitty named Dragon for approximately $170,000, or the equivalent of 600 ETH in cryptocurrency. “I bit Rebecca Black when I was younger, but those days are gone,” her description reads. “Believe it or not, spying on the neighbors is seriously exhilarating. You should try it some time. Let’s connect on ICQ.” She is described as having chestnut eyes and a cotton-candy-colored coat. As a game, CryptoKitties was one of the earliest attempts to leverage blockchain technology for leisure. Like real cats, each virtual cat carries a unique DNA, and their traits, called cattributes, can be passed down to offspring. Each virtual cat is unique and cannot be replicated or transferred without the owner’s permission, according to Axiom Zen, the studio behind the game. Generally, earlier generations of the virtual cats are deemed more valuable, making Dragon a rarity in the game — she’s a ninth-generation CryptoKitty. Newer virtual cats have an average selling price of around $60, according to , and a median price of $9.  The previous sales record for the game was held by CryptoKitty Founder Cat #18, which sold for 253 ETH in December, or approximately $110,000 CryptoKitty #4 sold for $107,000. Both Founder Cat #18 and #4 are both Gen 0 cats, making them more valuable. Dragon is CryptoKitty #896775. It’s unclear why Dragon fetched such a high price, but Rabona is now her new proud owner. Although Axiom Zen generally doesn’t comment on sales, the studio speculated that “maybe there was a personal connection the buyer had to the cat or the seller.” Other theories range from the whimsical (she bit Rebecca Black) to the more cynical (it was a way to launder money), according to . The sale of Dragon may lead to a new resurgence for the game and the app. Since its height in December, the total transactions on the app has dropped by 98.4 percent in January, and volume has remained slow since. Over the past day, Dragon’s sale has elevated the game’s trading volume to the highest level since February. Another milestone is also coming up: CryptoKitties is about to celebrate its millionth virtual cat.",

    "detailContent": "  stemming from the RWTH Aachen University in Germany reveals that despite a dramatic fall of interest in cryptocurrency mining, the Coinhive JavaScript-based miner is , generating around $250,000 worth of digital Monero coins each month, depending on the current value. Coinhive also contributes 1.18 percent of the total mining power behind the Monero blockchain.  stems from . It’s meant to be integrated into websites to tap into the unused portions of your processor and mine digital Monero coins in the background. Released in 2017, Coinhive’s code targets websites that want to make money without running annoying advertisements. The tradeoff is that your PC slows down while it generates digital coins in exchange for ad-free viewing. But hackers are taking advantage of Coinhive’s potential by breaking into websites, secretly installing the code, and configuring Coinhive to send the resulting Monero to their digital wallets. They are also inserting Coinhive into web browser extensions that appear legitimate on the surface. “If we sum up the block rewards of the actually mined blocks over the observation period of four weeks, we find that Coinhive earned 1,271 XMR,” the report states. “Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Monero’s exchange-rate fluctuates heavily, at time of writing one XMR is worth $200, having peaked at $400 at the beginning of the year.” At the time of this publication, the worth of a single Monero digital coin (XMR) dropped to $82. That’s still no chump change at $104,222 for four weeks worth of mining. The Coinhive developers get a chunk of that stash, too, earning 30 percent from each mined XMR. Where is all of this Monero going? The report claims most of the mined funds are piped to 10 individuals. They’re using a short link service provided by Coinhive that requires web surfers to mine Monero in order to reach their destination. Most of these are resolved in minutes while others require an “unfeasible” number of  — in the millions — to compute. “This link redirection monetization is comparable to short link services delaying the redirection while serving advertisements and paying the link creator a commission,” the report explains. “With Coinhive, the creator of the short link receives a share of the block reward that is mined by the users visiting the short links.” To broadly detect web-based mining across the internet, the researchers ignored the public No Coin filter and developed a new technique based on WebAssembly. Scans showed Coinhive as the largest web-based mining provider to date with a 75 percent usage across mining websites. Other miners detected by this technique include , , and . No Coin is actually a browser extension with a blacklist that blocks sites with cryptocurrency mining code. The argument is that even though using these miners is great for removing ads, visitors don’t have means to opt out of the mining process. It’s separate from your typical ad-blocking solution because it addresses a different browsing problem. This extension is available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.",

    "title": "Researchers Successfully Hacked Bitfi\u0027s Allegedly Secure Crypto Wallet | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Antivirus pioneer John McAfee’s  wallet has been hacked again by security researchers. McAfee announced a partnership with Bitfi in late July to promote the security of that company’s cryptocurrency wallet. However, it seems that Bitfi was prematurely confident about the security of its digital wallet, as hackers have been able to penetrate the McAfee Bitfi account numerous times. In the latest hack, researchers were able to send signed transactions with the wallet despite Bitfi’s security mechanisms. After completing the hack, researchers are confident that they have fulfilled the requirements needed to claim the $100,000 bug bounty prize announced by McAfee. “For all you naysayers who claim that ‘nothing is unhackable’ \u0026 who don’t believe that my Bitfi wallet is truly the world’s first unhackable device, a $100,000 bounty goes to anyone who can hack it,” McAfee tweeted in July. The bug bounty required hackers to demonstrate that they’re able to modify the device, connect to Bitfi’s servers, and send data from the device. Researchers were able to gain root access to the device two weeks ago, and they have confirmed that the device was still connected to Bitfi’s servers. To fulfill the last requirement, security researcher Andrew Tierney confirmed that he was able to send the device’s private keys and passphrase to a remote server,  reported. “We have sent the seed and phrase from the device to another server — it just gets sent using netcat, nothing fancy.” said Tierney. “We believe all [conditions] have been met.” The latest hack on McAfee’s Bitfi wallet comes within days after 15-year-old Saleem Rashid demonstrated that he was able to crack the wallet to . In that attempt, even though Rashid was able to hack the wallet, he was not able to access the cryptocurrency that was stored in McAfee’s account. McAfee had downplayed Rashid’s hack in a tweet, noting: “A video played on your Bitfi wallet has nothing to do with the safety of your funds. This is amateur hour, not a hack!” McAffee has not offered any comment about the most recent hack conducted by Tierney. Since announcing his partnership with Bitfi, McAffee said on August 13 that he is now CEO of Luxcore, a company that works on enterprise blockchain solutions.

On July 18, Ricky Joseph Handschumacher was arrested in Pasco County, Florida, and charged with grand theft and money laundering. He has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted to being part of the organization. While Handschumacher was arrested in Flordia, the first break in this case occurred in Michigan. In February of this year, a mother called the police when she heard her son talking on the phone and pretending to work for AT\u0026T. Upon responding to the report, police found numerous cell phones and SIM cards, as well as computer files that contained “an extensive list of names and phone numbers of people from around the world.” In March, police followed up on their investigation and discovered the same person using a library’s public Wi-Fi to access personal data. From there, the police seized several dozen SIM cards, a computer, and a Trezor Wallet. The next month, the son’s mother called the police again, saying that her son had gotten another cell phone. After obtaining permission to search the young man’s room, the police found an extensive collection of SIM cards, cell phones, and forged documents. The police used the forged documents to contact some of the victims of this crime. Three of the victims reported that, together, they had lost roughly $350,000 in various cryptocurrencies. However, that was only the beginning as follow-up investigations revealed that this ring extended far beyond Michigan. The group, which reportedly consists of at least nine people, was spread across multiple states. They made use of  and Telegram to plan their heists. The group’s biggest score, that authorities know of, came in May of this year when members worked together to steal 57 Bitcoins from a single victim. The value of Bitcoin tends to fluctuate, but at the time, the 57 Bitcoins were worth almost $470,000. While the group’s heist of 57 Bitcoins was a large one, their ambitions were set even higher. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement allegedly uncovered the group discussing their plans to hack the CEO of Gemini Trust Company, a . As for Handschumacher, Discord appears to be his undoing. The efforts of law enforcement officers in Michigan allowed the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office to obtain a warrant to monitor the group’s  chat. From there, they allegedly saw that Handschumacher was bragging about the group’s success and using his share of the earnings to buy a host of expensive items including a new house and real estate.",

He also placed a bounty on it, offering $250,000 to anyone who could hack the device and steal Bitcoin from the cloud-connected wallet. Within weeks, several hacks of the device had been completed, leading to people modifying its boot screen. Now, a self-described “adversarial thinker” has rooted it completely.

As “Abe Snowman” alludes to in the replies to the above tweet, there are reasons that security researchers are heading down this path of cracking the device. The press claiming the BitFi wallet has been hacked. Utter nonsense. The wallet is hacked when someone gets the coins. No-one got any coins. Gaining root access in an attempt to get the coins is not a hack. It\u0026#39;s a failed attempt. All these alleged \u0026quot;hacks\u0026quot; did not get the coins. \u0026mdash; John McAfee (@officialmcafee)  BitFi itself continues to defend the unhackable nature of its device, though it has made some statements to distance itself from McAfee, as . It also recently fired its social media coordinator after a series of defamatory tweets, which hasn’t left the company in good standing. Indeed, such actions have landed BitFi with a nomination for the  which is quite an achievement in itself.

The reveal arrives by way of the company’s announcement regarding the Google Cloud Next ’18 conference in San Francisco starting Tuesday, July 24. Google will have a 50-minute session called “” talking about Google’s partners and how to develop blockchain-based solutions. “Customers can now explore ways they might use distributed ledger technology (DLT) frameworks on GCP with launch partners including Digital Asset and BlockApps, and try open-source integrations for Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum later this year in our GCP Marketplace,” . For the uninitiated, a distributed ledger, or blockchain, is a decentralized database shared and maintained by connected computers across the globe. Each transaction can be publicly read while securely stored using cryptography. These transactions cannot be altered without modifying the entire chain because the cryptographic key of one transaction is stored in the next transaction. Blockchain technology is highly associated with cryptocurrencies, but companies such as Google and Microsoft are examining how their services would benefit from the maturing technology. According to , Google was the second-most active blockchain investor between 2012 and 2017, falling between SBI Holdings and Overstock.com. Others include CITI and Goldman Sachs. Along with Google,  for the Google Cloud Platform, announcing that both its blockchain platform and developer toolset are now offered through Google’s cloud. Developers can now build, test and deploy solutions on-demand based on Digital Asset’s blockchain without any need to make manual configurations. “We’re partnering with Google Cloud to provide developers with a full stack solution so they can unleash the potential for web-paced innovation in blockchain,” Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset, said in a statement. “This will reduce the technical barriers to DLT application development by delivering our advanced distributed ledger platform and modeling language to Google Cloud.” Google will also provide a preview of the Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) toolkit for building blockchain-based applications. Google is one of the select few technology partners chosen to participate in Digital Asset’s limited beta for the DAML kit preview. The DAML Platform-as-a-service will also be provided on the Google Cloud Platform.  as well, announcing that its  for enterprise will be made available on the Google Cloud Platform. The company described Google’s entrance into the blockchain field as a “landmark event.” “Based on the Ethereum protocol, BlockApps STRATO provides enterprise-grade API integration capabilities, configurable consensus algorithms, and the capability to query and report on blockchain data using a traditional SQL database,” BlockApps says. “Application developers will find STRATO familiar, easy to use, and easy to integrate with existing enterprise systems.”  that Google is working on its own blockchain technology that third parties can use to post and verify transactions. Google will supposedly provide a “white version” of this technology as well that companies can run locally on their own servers rather than through Google’s cloud.",

    "detailContent": " Congressman Brad Sherman, D-California, believes the government should prohibit U.S. citizens from mining and using cryptocurrencies.  during  of a subcommittee for the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, adding that as a medium of exchange, cryptocurrencies accomplish nothing except facilitating narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and tax evasion. “Some of its supporters delight in that if you can disempower the U.S. government from being able to prevent terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and tax evasion, you have somehow struck a blow for liberty,” he said during a five-minute statement. “That is reason enough to ban it.” Part of his argument is that mining alone requires large amounts of power that takes away from other needs and/or adds to the current power footprint. Its role as an investment is also deemed “bad” as instead of gambling in Las Vegas — which in turn feeds casinos, restaurants, and hotels that pay high local taxes — “animal spirits” are gambling on virtual coins, helping to create a market for tax evaders, terrorists, and so on. That said, he believes these gamblers should invest in risky stock instead. More importantly, if U.S. citizens purchase cryptocurrencies, investor protection needs to be in place as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . He went on to add that any person or firm selling stocks, bonds, or any other investment should be charged with fraud and incarcerated for issuing crypto-offering memoranda and crypto-registrations. “The money that we make as a country because we’re the reserve currency, because we can issue a greenback that does not yield interest, there are people who are alive today because of the profits the U.S. government makes on that whether it be to fund our defense or medical research,” he concluded. “All of that gets diminished with cryptocurrency.” But Norbert Michel, director for the Center for Data Analysis at the Heritage Foundation and one of four on the panel, argued against the notion to ban cryptocurrency. Sure, criminals use Bitcoin, but they also use other tools for their devious deeds such as airplanes, computers, and automobiles. We don’t criminalize those tools simply because they’re used by criminals. Why is cryptocurrency any different? More importantly, cash is still the most-used currency across North America. But U.S. citizens also use a form of digital currency: Electronic payments. For instance, a worker could get a direct deposit into his bank, never seeing cash or a physical check. He then purchases goods from Amazon with his bank card, again not using physical money. Cryptocurrency is just a new form of electronic payment that should be embraced and treated like any other form of payment. Also brought up during the hearing was the idea of central banks issuing their own digital currency. Alex Pollock from the R Street Institute refuted the idea, as these banks would compete directly with the Federal Reserve. Having central banks issue digital currencies is “one of the worst financial ideas of recent times,” he said.",

The dark web gambling ring, which made its fortunes by facilitating bets on the World Cup,  only accepted payments in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Etherum. The South China Morning Post reports that this was the first major Chinese gambling ring to make use of digital currencies. Law enforcement from the Guangdong province said that during its eight months of operation, the site drew approximately 330,000 users from multiple different countries. The police also report that the site employed more than 8,000 operators who would earn commissions for recruiting new members into what is being described as a pyramid scheme. Chinese authorities said that the syndicate’s ringleaders took advantage of China’s lax rules governing cryptocurrencies to make “huge profits.” While the aforementioned incident is China’s largest example of World Cup gambling, it is far from the only one. Chinese law enforcement have embarked on a campaign meant to root out the various gambling rings that have risen during the World Cup. Law enforcement from the Guangdong province reported that they have arrested 540 suspects and frozen 260 million yuan in cases related to illegal gambling on the World Cup. However, they say that the recently busted crypto ring is the largest of such operations to date. In addition to cracking down on illegal activities fostered by cryptocurrencies, China is also taking a stricter stance toward digital currencies in general. In September of last year, the government shut down Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges and banned initial coin offerings. The government cited concerns that cryptocurrencies were unregulated and could be a destabilizing influence on the Chinese economy. Those efforts appear to have been somewhat successful as the Chinese central bank has reported that trading between yuan and Bitcoin now accounts for less than one percent of the world’s Bitcoin trades. Despite the currency’s reputation for illegal dealings, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have plenty of legitimate uses whether as a simple hobby or as a means of .

    "detailContent": " An 11-count federal indictment filed against 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleges that the group used cryptocurrency to remain anonymous in a scheme against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016. They are accused of using these digital coins to pay for the website used to release and publicize stolen election-related documents, keeping their true identities hidden. A month before releasing the stolen documents, the group registered the  domain and leased a virtual private server through an online cryptocurrency service, according to the indictment. After that, they registered an URL-shortening account that was used to “spear phish” the Clinton campaign chairman and “other campaign-related individuals.” From the time of the site’s launch until the end of the election, the group released emails stolen from the Clinton campaign and affiliated individuals, along with documents obtained through previous spear-phishing operations. The site claimed that it was run by “American hactivists” and received more than 1 million page views before it was shut down in March 2017. At its core, cryptocurrency was designed to keep users anonymous … at least, in theory. In the case of Bitcoin, you can send and receive digital currency without supplying personal information, but you’re seemingly doing so under what could be deemed a pseudonym. The address (wallet) where you send and receive digital currency remains in a public ledger, so if that address is ever linked to your real name, any type of anonymity is flushed down the toilet. According to the indictment filed by the Department of Justice, all 12 accused are members of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, or GRU, that’s part of the Russian military. They are charged with hacking into the computer networks of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic National Committee using the names DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and “another entity.” , who were officials in Unit 26165 and Unit 74455 of the Russian government’s Main Intelligence Directorate at the time of the attacks. For instance, Unit 26165 used spear-phishing campaigns against volunteers and employees of the Clinton campaign to steal usernames and passwords, and hack into other computers to steal emails and documents. The Department of Justice claims Unit 26165 worked with Unit 74455 to release those documents. Meanwhile, Unit 74455 hacked into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S.-based companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of elections. “To avoid detection, defendants used false identities while using a network of computers located around the world, including the United States, paid for with cryptocurrency through  and other means intended to obscure the origin of the funds,” the Department of Justice states. “This funding structure supported their efforts to buy key accounts, servers, and domains.” Here are the charges: The FBI’s cyber teams in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and San Francisco helped with the investigation,",

    "detailContent": " A federal judge sentenced Theresa Tetley, also known as the “Bitcoin Maven,” to one year in federal prison for operating an illegal money business. Federal prosecutors charged the former stockbroker with operating an unregistered money transmission business and laundering  in at least one case that comes from proceeds from narcotics activity. As part of her sentence, U.S. District Judge Manual Real also ordered Tetley to forfeit 40 Bitcoins — worth approximately $270,000 — along with nearly $300,000 in cash and 25 gold bars. Federal authorities were already in possession of those assets after they had seized them last year as part of the investigation. The former stockbroker made more than $300,000 each year as a result of trading Bitcoin, court documents revealed, by running a Bitcoin-for-cash exchange service. However, Tetley did not register her business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and she also did not implement any mechanism to prevent money laundering. Tetley promoted her business on localbitcoins.com, and the government alleged that she had exchanged between $6 million to $9.5 million for customers, charging higher rates than competitors who were registered with FinCEN. “As a result of operating this unregistered business, Tetley facilitated laundering for one individual who is suspected of receiving Bitcoin from unlawful activity, such as sales of drugs on the dark web,” the government  in a case that was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Puneet Kakkar of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Section. “In the course of her business, Tetley also conducted an exchange of Bitcoin-for-cash for an undercover agent who represented that his Bitcoin were the proceeds of narcotics trafficking.” Tetley was arrested following a March 2017 sting operation where a Drug Enforcement Agency officer had approached Tetley posing as a drug dealer. In that instance, Tetley had agreed to exchange the agent’s Bitcoin, which was represented to come from trafficking drugs, for $300,000 in cash that delivered in two Trader Joe’s paper shopping bags. The government also alleged that Tetley exchanged more than $6 million for William Farber, a man that was charged last year for running a drug ring, the  reported. The Justice Department argued that Tetley should be sentenced to a longer term because she had knowledge that the funds came from illegal means. During her sentencing, Tetley asked for leniency,  reported. “But I screwed up epically,” she told the court. “It quickly became a business — and I broke all sorts of laws. I have learned my lessons.” Even though the case against Tetley is said to be the first of its kind in the Central District of California, there have been similar cases in other parts of the country.",

The Finney is a  that connects you to the , integrating blockchain technology and key cryptocurrency tools, with one of the world’s most secure mobile operating systems to keep everything safe. At this point, due to the overexposure this tech has been having recently, you’re either desperate to read on, or about to quickly navigate away. If you’re in the latter camp, wait just a second. Sirin Labs knows it’s dealing with an industry that’s confusing, dense, and seemingly made up of buzzwords. The company understands this problem, and has genuinely made the Finney phone simple to use, opening up a fascinating new technology in a way that’s understandable and interesting to the average human being. We’ve seen a prototype of the phone, and sat down with the people bringing it to life, in order to have our minds changed about what initially sounds like a niche device useful only to a few billionaires around the world. In the U.S. alone, Sirin Labs research discovered 25 million people have cryptocurrency tokens and are therefore likely to be actively speculating. It’s difficult to call that a niche, and it’s obvious by the amount of press, the countless seminars and conventions, and money that’s being made from it and blockchain technology that there is a highly motivated community behind cryptocurrency. They’re the ones who will love the Finney phone first; but once the geeks are onboard, Sirin Labs is coming for you. We asked Nimrod May, Sirin Labs’ chief marketing officer, if the Finney phone will be the device for people to get started with cryptocurrencies. He emphatically replied, “Absolutely, 100 percent, yes.” Developed by Sirin Labs’ team of 70 over the past 18 months, many of whom were already blockchain and cryptocurrency fans before the project started, the company wants Finney to bridge the gap between the blockchain and the mass market. Sirin Labs co-CEO Zvika Landau explained the vision for the Finney phone’s user friendliness further. Once the geeks are onboard, Sirin Labs is coming for you. “Most people are afraid of cryptocurrencies, and don’t know where to start,” Landau said. “The user experience we want is one that is so simple, you won’t need to understand how blockchain technology works, you won’t need to understand how to sign a transaction, or what happens in the background at the time.” Think of the Finney phone with its integrated cryptocurrency support as an alternative to an iPhone with Apple Pay, or an  phone with Google Pay. That’s how Sirin Labs envisages its potential impact. It’s acutely aware of how much hand-holding it will need to still do, and will not only transform its London store into an educational center-style showroom, but also hold events and meetups around the world to get people started. At the moment, crypto transactions are complicated, with multiple tokens, security threats, no central organization for protection, and complicated wallets for storing cryptocurrencies accessed either online, or offline with the help of hardware like a USB stick. Hardly the most user-friendly system, or one that encourages anyone to make fast, real-world payments. The Finney phone streamlines all this, and aims to take away the hassle. You may remember Sirin Labs’ first phone, the monstrously expensive, hand-finished  with its Android-based Sirin OS software, which focused on . The Finney phone’s version of Sirin OS uses 80 percent of the Solarin’s software, with additional measures directly related to cryptocurrency use added in. Specifically, it includes a multi-layer cyber security suite, a DApp decentralized app store, a token conversion system, and an embedded cold storage wallet. The cold wallet gives the Finney its wow factor. The cold wallet gives the Finney its wow factor. While phones  have become popular this year, the top of the Finney phone extends up to open the cold wallet and reveal a 2-inch second screen for the authentication key. When the screen is closed the cold wallet, which uses its own separate micro-controller unit (MCU), is totally shut down. Your wallet is safe and disconnected from the internet. The private key is kept in a separate secure zone, similar to that used on the Solarin phone. You slide up the screen manually, it’s not motorized, and on the version we tried the action was smooth and nicely dampened. Too nice, actually, and the temptation was there to flip it up and down subconsciously. This wouldn’t be a good thing, and would activate the wallet endlessly, so Sirin Labs is engineering it so there’s enough resistance to stop that temptation. We haven’t tried the phone outside of sliding up and down the cold wallet, as the device was a non-working prototype made to show the design, therefore we cannot comment on any aspects of the software, its operation, or actually carrying out a transaction using the Finney. What we do know is a complete rundown of the specs. It has a Snapdragon 845 processor with 6GB of  at its heart, along with a 6-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio screen —  — and a 12-megapixel single-lens camera on the back. The selfie camera has 8 megapixels, there’s a 3,280mAh battery inside, and 128GB of internal storage space. The body style is reminiscent of the Solarin, with flowing curves on the ends and sides, but without the expensive materials that pushed the price of its first phone into the stratosphere. The Finney phone costs $1,000, and is currently being produced by Foxconn. It will launch in November and be available to buy almost immediately afterwards, with the final dates still to come. It can be pre-ordered  now, if you’re really keen. The second desktop device discussed when the Finney phone was first officially announced will not come at launch, but in 2019, a year when Sirin Labs has big plans. Over the coming year, Sirin Labs will connect Finney phones to a blockchain network, which will run services that use Sirin Labs own SRN token. Beyond that, the Sirin OS is open source and other manufacturers will be able to create their own super-secure blockchain phones, plus Sirin will release a software development kit to help integrate apps and tokens. While names were not mentioned, Sirin Labs said it has been approached by “six or seven” manufacturers already. Prior to our meeting, rumors spread that , although it has not been officially tied with Sirin Labs yet. The company won’t have a say in how these other devices are developed, or force the use of a second screen for the cold wallet; but it plans to protect its brand by eventually adding a “Sirin OS Inside” style tag to devices. The timing of the Finney phone is fascinating. What about the SRN token? This is Sirin Labs own cryptocurrency, and its initial coin offering (ICO) raised $157 million. When you buy the Finney phone, you’ll be able to do so with a credit card; but Sirin Labs will convert that payment into SRN tokens. The harsh reality, if that’s what it is, is Sirin Labs isn’t a hardware manufacturer expecting to make money from its devices. It likely expects to make money from a service — in this case the SRN token and its blockchain ecosystem. It’s the same approach Apple took with the iPhone and the App Store. The potential is there too, because of the simplicity envisioned by the team. The Finney phone brings together a token conversion system, a cold wallet, lots of security, and everything else one needs to use cryptocurrencies into a single, easy to use device. Using the Finney phone to pay will be as simple as using the camera to scan a barcode, then the onboard cold wallet to secure the transaction. That’s it. Except, not really. Options are limited for regular people to use cryptocurrencies in everyday situations. It’s almost solely used for speculation, fundraising, and for purchases of questionable legality at the moment. There are other decentralized apps and services, such as the r — which will be pre-installed on the Finney phone — or games like , but it’s not for your weekly shop yet. It also doesn’t instantly make entering the cryptocurrency world any less financially risky than it is now. However, things are changing. The risks associated with cryptocurrency won’t affect the Finney phone or Sirin OS, and are mostly caused by speculators. “As more people adopt cryptocurrency for daily usage, it will become more stable, which will encourage more people to use it,” Landau told Digital Trends. The Finney phone has the potential to lessen the turmoil by speeding up the adoption of cryptocurrencies around the world. The timing of this phone is fascinating, coming when attention on blockchain and cryptocurrencies is at fever pitch. May knows the opportunity is there, saying, “If you come with the right product and the right technology, you have the chance of changing the world.” He is first to admit the pretentiousness of the statement, but it’s impossible to deny the prospects here, and only the shortsighted would fail to be excited by them. However, like cryptocurrency itself, it now needs to live up to the hype.",

    "title": "What Is Ethereum? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " With more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies out there, Ethereum has risen to the top of the pile, with its name often mentioned in the same breath as Bitcoin. Although its value is no way near that of the  and some of its more advanced features give it some exciting potential for the future. But what exactly is Ethereum, and what does it mean for the future of cryptocurrency (and even society at large)? Here’s the rundown. Although it does have its differences, on the surface at least, Ethereum functions as a cryptocurrency much like most others. Ethereum’s token, “Ether,” works in a . You can buy and sell it, with confirmations for transactions handled . In that way, the broad strokes of Ethereum are similar to  It means owners can use Ether for conducting transactions online, or save it and potentially make money from its growing value — it grew from around $10 per Ether at the start of 2017, to more than $1,100 at the start of the next. As much as Ethereum and Bitcoin do share some similarities though, the two platforms have different goals. Where Bitcoin is strictly a digital currency, designed to function as a means of payment or a store of value, Ethereum takes a grander approach. Ethereum functions as a platform through which people can use Ether tokens to create and run applications and, more importantly, smart contracts.  are contracts written in code, which the creator(s) upload to the blockchain. Any time one of those contracts is executed, every node on the network runs it, uploaded to the blockchain. That means it’s stored in the public ledger and is theoretically tamper-proof. Smart contracts are essentially structured as  When certain conditions are met, the program carries out the terms of the contract. As a theoretical example, say you want to rent a car from a service that uses Ethereum. A smart contract is generated, stipulating that if you send the required amount of funds, then the service will send you a digital key to unlock the car. The process is carried out on the blockchain, so when you send the Ether tokens, everyone on the network can see that you did so. Likewise, when the rental service sends you the key to unlock the car, everyone will see it. In this scenario, the contract might state that if the service does not send you the key, the tokens are refunded. Since every computer on the network is keeping track of the transaction through the blockchain, there is no way to tamper with it. If someone altered the details of the contract, every copy of the digital ledger would note it. Every program on Ethereum uses a distinct amount of processing power, and since the program must be run by the nodes, it is important to keep superfluous activity to a minimum. This is why every contract and program on Ethereum is given a cost in “gas.” Gas is a measurement of how much processing power the program will require, and the higher the gas requirement, the more Ether tokens the user will need to spend. One of the commonly cited advantages of smart contracts is that there is no need for “middlemen” like lawyers or notaries. In theory, this means that you can carry out transactions without the waiting times inherent to paper filings, and without paying fees to whoever would typically oversee such a transaction. This is particularly important for people living in countries where the legal system is corrupt, or woefully inefficient. Of course, the automation means that, if something goes wrong — if, for example, there is a bug in the code of the smart contract — the blockchain will still carry out the terms of the contract, which could be problematic. Ethereum has cast an enormous shadow during its short time in the spotlight. The platform has already attracted massive corporations like JP Morgan Chase, AMD, and Microsoft, who are among the more notable members of the  which provides “Resources for businesses to learn about Ethereum and leverage this groundbreaking technology to address specific industry use cases.” That bodes well for Ethereum’s usage in the business world, though true believers see the platform as something more than a tool for corporations. They see it as a way to decentralize the internet — and make it more democratic. In , Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin laid out his view of how Ethereum will disrupt the traditional power structures of the world: “I think a large part of the consequence is necessarily going to be disempowering some of these centralized players to some extent. Because ultimately power is a zero sum game. And if you talk about empowering the little guy, as much as you want to couch it in flowery terminology that makes it sound fluffy and good, you are necessarily disempowering the big guy. And personally I say screw the big guy. They have enough money already.” Smart contracts could free individuals from the constraints of the legal system and big business. However, technology enthusiasts often promise such utopian futures. Just as social media has helped , Ethereum and the automated, decentralized internet it seeks may have unintended consequences, as the DAO hacking indicates. Mining Ethereum with consumer graphics cards was also a  in that and associated industries over the past year. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ether is prone to wild fluctuations in value too, as we’ve seen . Whether Ethereum is sturdy enough to survive long-term, or is an ephemeral trend, remains up in the air.",

    "detailContent": "  the current overabundance of add-in desktop graphics cards as to why you’re not already seeing Nvidia’s new GeForce GTX 11 Series on store shelves. Nvidia reportedly has around 1 million chips ready for release but is holding back because there is simply no room for the next-generation cards. This is why  that the launch would be “a long time from now.” The problem stems from cryptocurrency. Throughout 2017, as values climbed through the roof, miners scooped up every  they could find, leaving store shelves barren. The few cards you could find on the internet suffered crazy overinflated prices due to sellers taking advantage of the product void. To meet the rising demand in the cryptocurrency and gaming markets, Nvidia and its partners created more cards. But then in 2018 cryptocurrency prices tanked. Individuals and small organizations closed shop while the larger miners cut back on their purchases including the ASIC systems designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining. With all that digital coin digging slowing to a crawl, the market currently has“around several million units” collecting dust on store shelves. To make room for new GTX 11 Series products, graphics card prices may be reduced 20 percent starting in July. Prices presented by retailers may get even lower once cryptocurrency miners begin selling their used equipment at dirt-cheap prices. The current overflow likely affects the revenue of every party involved including Nvidia, its partners, the company that actually manufactures the chips (TSMC) and more. China’s Sichuan province could help with the overstocking issue. This region accounts for nearly 70 percent of China’s mining operations, which  that damaged many of its cryptocurrency mining operations. These operators will be looking to replace their damaged hardware including whatever Nvidia-based graphics cards they had installed. Despite the inventory issue, Nvidia’s GTX 11 Series may still get an introduction during Gamescom in August. Nvidia is sending individuals in the press out to the convention in Germany, meaning the company likely isn’t spending that kind of money just to showcase PC games running on current hardware. There is no reason why Nvidia couldn’t reveal the series at that time if the company has the hardware ready. But a retail release could reside in the fourth quarter, depending on the current-generation stockpile. Most of the “Turning” GPUs Nvidia reportedly has locked and loaded will ship out to third-party manufacturers while the company will reserve a batch for its own first-party “Founders Edition” cards. Previous reports said Nvidia’s partners would receive the chips by the end of August or early September, putting product availability between weeks or several months thereafter. Mass production of Micron’s GDDR6 graphics memory didn’t even begin until June. The GTX 11 Series will include both desktop and mobile products later this year, including the GTX 1180 add-in card and the GTX 1160 6GB chip for notebooks.",

    "title": "A Look Into Bitcoin\u0027s Troubled Year of Steady Decline | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Last year, Bitcoin seemed nearly unstoppable. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency rose to just under $20,000 and saw people investing heavily in the cryptocurrency rather that be through buying directly or simply buying the hardware needed to mine it. This, in turn, saw GPUs rise to absurdly high prices though  in the company’s fortunes. This year, however, has seen the cryptocurrency’s fortune’s take a turn for the worst. Currently, the coin is valued at $6,331, according to , but, on the 28th, it fell as low as $5,800 which is the lowest the coin has been this year. Even this month’s highest price point of more than $7,300 is still nearly $10,000 lower than it was near the beginning of this year when the coin was still worth more than $17,000. Along with declining prices has came a decline in consumer interest in the currency. Looking at , we can see that the currency hit its peak search popularity during the week of January 14th and fell off rather sharply since that time period. The first couple of weeks of June appear to be the coin’s low point in terms of search popularity, but the coin’s rebound has been a sluggish one. Using Google’s own scale, we can see that it recently hit a low point of 13 in terms of search interest and is currently hovering around 18. It is difficult to say rather the low value led to a loss of consumer interest or the other way around. More than likely, it is a mixture of multiple factors that have led to the coin’s decline. Chief among them are a number of recent hacks which have seen cryptocurrency exchanges . While Bitcoin itself was rarely the target of these hacks, they likely shook consumer confidence in the security of cryptocurrencies especially considering the fact that there is no central organization to insure such currencies. Of course, just because the government isn’t insuring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, doesn’t mean it isn’t willing to tax and regulate it. This year, the IRS announced it would begin. In a lot of ways, it seems that Bitcoin is assuming many of the risks of being an unregulated currency while losing many of the benefits in regards to taxation and oversight. It’s too soon to declare Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies “dead,” but many experts are advising investors to use caution when considering the currency.",

    "title": "What Is Bitcoin? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Bitcoin. It’s a word that was once merely discussed as an academic idea among technology enthusiasts, then became a hushed mention among law enforcement tackling online drug trades — and most recently it was craze for those looking to make a quick buck. But what is Bitcoin? Why are people so interested in it? Most notably, it’s not a real, physical thing, but an entirely digital entity (no matter what the header image may suggest) with no middle-man controlling its use. To put it simply, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency, of which Bitcoin was the first and still the foremost, is an entirely digital form of currency. Think of it like the way you operate your online bank account or use credit cards. You never have to physically have that money to own it or use it. The same is true with Bitcoin — it’s just numbers in a wallet — but you can do a lot with them. Bitcoin sits atop the public ledger that is  and is gradually created by a practice called “mining.” Although the specifics of mining go beyond the scope of this article () in effect, powerful computers run incredibly complicated mathematical formulas to provide the verification for Bitcoin transactions, and at the same time create new Bitcoins. The difficulty of this formula creates scarcity. There’s also a hard limit on how much can ever be produced — 21 million Bitcoins, to be specific. While we’re a long way to that happening, that limit makes Bitcoin quite different from the dollars and pounds we are so used to. Many successors to Bitcoin have decided not to use a hard-coded limit, so this trait is somewhat unique. Bitcoin differs from traditional currencies, like the U.S. dollar or British pound, in an important way — it isn’t backed by any central organization, or a physical item, like gold. The value of a single Bitcoin is based entirely on what people consider it to be worth. Much of that is related to what you can use it for and the quantity of product or service you receive in return. Of course, money’s value has long been based largely on a perception of worth. That’s why economic panics can cause a run on a bank, or inflation can go out of control. Yet there’s always been some underlying guarantor — usually a government — offering the promise of stability. Bitcoin doesn’t have that. It was created independent of any government, and remains independent. Its value is dictated entirely by the market for it. It has soared to incredible heights, but has also experienced huge price shocks, and there’s been many accusations of insider trading, price manipulation, and other dubious tactics. Governments have strict measures to prevent these problems in their currency — though they don’t always work — but Bitcoin, being independent, can’t implement such checks, and . One of the core purposes of Bitcoin, from its original creation, was as a transactional medium. That is, it’s used in place of traditional currency. When stored  like , it can be sent to another wallet anywhere in the world to pay for goods or services, and over the years it’s been used for just that. For those who don’t have the time or computational resources to mine Bitcoin themselves — today you would need to to hope for even a modicum return on your investment — they can buy it. There are a number of ways to do so, but typically it involves sending an amount of traditional currency to a person who owns Bitcoin, who in turn sends the relevant amount of currency to your wallet. One of the most highly publicized ways Bitcoin has been used for transactions over the years has been for  drug sales. Thanks to the anonymous nature of the cryptocurrency, it’s been utilized to pay for illicit substances and other items over Tor-accessible websites like the infamous . It’s also facilitated the rise in ransomware. That’s not to say that Bitcoin  though. Indeed, it can also be used to give to charities, pay for gift cards, pizzas and airline travel, and it’s even found usage as a day-to-day way of  of their own. Back when Bitcoin was first created, individual “coins” had no intrinsic value. What they were worth was negotiated, with one person once offering 10,000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas. Over time, though, as more uses for the currency have been created and it’s grown more popular, Bitcoin’s value has risen in turn. While a single Bitcoin was worth pennies in 2010, today it’s worth more than $6,000, having peaked at more than $19,000 at the end of 2017. For this reason, over the past few years and most notably in 2017, people have begun to see Bitcoin as a store of value. Although extremely volatile compared to more typical systems like stocks, shares, or gold, Bitcoin has become a popular way for people to invest their money and for some, it’s paid dividends. Those who purchased Bitcoin at the start of 2017 saw a near 20-fold return on their investment throughout it, leading some to suggest that Bitcoin could be worth seven figures by 2020. It is important to note that this extreme optimism has given rise to a lot of uninformed investment in what is still a relatively unproven digital medium. It is far closer to gambling in terms of its potential for financial gain and loss, and there have been many sad stories of people losing huge sums during big downturns in the currency’s value. There are many people who have a lot to say about Bitcoin, both bad and good. Some see it as a way to make a quick buck as it jumps up and down in value, while others see it as an entirely new economic model. It’s also possible that Bitcoin itself, as impactful as it has been, will be most successful as the progenitor of underlying technologies like the blockchain and newer . The future of Bitcoin is far from guaranteed, but its impact on the world of finance, online transactions, and on many people’s bank balances, cannot be denied. It’s been a force for good, for bad, and everything in between — and it will be well remembered, even if it doesn’t reach the heady heights that so many predict.",

    "detailContent": " Talk about a mix of the old and the new. Oklahoma-based Classic Recreations, known for , now accepts cryptocurrency as payment. The company claims to be the first custom-car builder to do so. Henceforth, Classic Recreations said it will accept multiple types of cryptocurrency “including, but not limited to,” , Bitcoin Cash, , Ethereum, and Docademic. The company has set up electronic wallet addresses associated with each cryptocurrency, as well as the obligatory encryption software to ensure privacy. Customers will transfer funds from their own electronic wallets to the appropriate Classic Recreations wallet. Jason Engel, the owner of Classic Recreations, believes cryptocurrency will allow the company to expand its customer base. “My entire life I have had a strong fascination for technology and its evolution,” Engel said in a statement. “Cryptocurrencies have come a long way and continue to solidify themselves as a legitimate currency on the global market. The truck beauty of accepting cryptocurrency is the universal aspect of it which allows Classic Recreations to connect with consumers from anywhere in the world.” The funny thing about accepting cryptocurrency is that Classic Recreations specializes in cars built decades before the creation of the internet. The company’s , for example, is an updated version of a 1967 Shelby GT500 Mustang. It features a 427-cubic-inch V8 that produces over 800 horsepower, plus modern brakes, tires, and suspension to help manage that power. Classic Recreations also offers tamer GT350CR and GT500CR models. The least expensive model starts at $149,000. Classic Recreations even got the green light from the Blue Oval to  of decades-old Ford Mustang models. The 1969 and 1970 Boss 429, Boss 302, and Mach 1 are some of the most desirable  around, and original versions are hard to come by today. Because the Boss and Mach 1 Mustangs are officially licensed by Ford, Classic Recreations prefers to call them “continuation cars” rather than replicas. Cars can be built off original Mustang bodies or new reproductions officially licensed by Ford, and get some modern upgrades. Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but the first completed Mustang Boss 429 will be unveiled in November at the 2018 SEMA Show in Las Vegas.",

    "title": "Facebook Backtracks on its Cryptocurrency Advertisement Ban Policy | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  about banning cryptocurrency-related advertisements from the social network. Since Tuesday, June 26,  will allow advertisements that promote cryptocurrency and related content, but only from pre-approved advertisers. Advertisements that promote initial coin offerings and binary options are still banned from Facebook’s pages.  to prohibit ads that promote “financial products and services” linked to “misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” Three examples given were binary options, initial coin offerings, and cryptocurrency. For example, an advertisement couldn’t promote purchasing Bitcoin using retirement funds, or purchasing ICO tokens at a discount. But cryptocurrency isn’t a problem: The issue resides with the people associated with cryptocurrency. For instance, one of the biggest scams is to lure hopeful investors into purchasing “valuable” tokens to financially help launch a new cryptocurrency. But instead of launching the new platform, scam artists are disappearing with the cash. This is one of the reasons why  originally cracked down on cryptocurrency-related advertisements. Yet given that Facebook generates revenue from advertisements, banning all cryptocurrency-related ads may not have been a great financial decision.  product management director Rob Leathern says that the company spent the last several months refining its advertisement policy to that some ads can safely show up on the social network. To enable these ads, Facebook implemented  that includes submitting licenses, trading information on a public stock exchange, and “other relevant public background” information regarding the business wanting to advertise. That said, not all cryptocurrency-related companies will pass ’s inspection. “We’ll listen to feedback, look at how well this policy works and continue to study this technology so that, if necessary, we can revise it over time,” Leathern says. “It’s important that we continue to help prevent or remove misleading advertising for these products and services.”  cryptocurrency-related advertisements from its AdWords platform in June, blocking ads related to “unregulated or speculative financial products.” Google lists cryptocurrency ads under its “emerging threats” banner given that digital currency isn’t regulated and therefore investors have no guarantee of safe, honest trading.  in late June or early July, banning cryptocurrency-related advertisements from Bing. The company sings a similar tune in its reasoning: Because cryptocurrency and related products aren’t regulated, there is potential for “bad actors to participate in predatory behaviors.” Microsoft already bans virtual currencies that are designed to facilitate illegal purposes, but now the company will ban all cryptocurrency ads. Outside of the search engines, the Twitter Ads platform began blocking advertisements in March that are related to cryptocurrency wallet services, initial coin offerings, and cryptocurrency exchanges that don’t meet specific requirements. Reddit began blocking cryptocurrency-related ads in early 2016, including Google-cached ads. Unfortunately, at least with Facebook, there is a possibility that something will slip through the cracks.

    "title": "(in)Secure: How Mastercard Is Making Real Money More Like Bitcoin | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, has captured the interest of everyone from  to Microsoft. One of the biggest investors in the technology has been Mastercard, holding nearly thirty blockchain patents to its name. What does a company like Mastercard want to do with all that blockchain tech?  It wants to make the future of money look a bit more like Bitcoin. According to the ATM Industry Association, two billion in losses from credit card “skimming” occur each year around the world. Using a skimming device at places like gas stations and ATMs, thieves can easily steal credit card information from those who previously used it. While chip cards have done a lot to solve that problem, companies like Mastercard always need to stay one step ahead of hackers. “Utilizing blockchain technology, Mastercard will be able to eradicate many of the fraudulent activities” “Every year, billions of dollars are stolen through identity theft and skimming credit cards,” said Arran Stewart, an expert on blockchain from Job.com, told Digital Trends. “Utilizing blockchain technology, Mastercard will be able to eradicate many of the fraudulent activities that happen through the abuse of their card services.” Stewart is the co-owner of the recruitment platform , which implements a smart contract on the blockchain to facilitate private information, not unlike how Mastercard proposes to do it. Mastercard’s patent would put credit cards on a publicly-accessible blockchain, which can then verify payments in a secured fashion. Stewart explained that Mastercard could remedy the problem by encoding an image of a payment card to the blockchain and then encrypt it with a public and private key. Once the payment is finished, the system decrypts the card image using those private keys. Despite blockchain’s many demonstrated use cases, its application in finances have always been important. It’s the backbone of how a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin functions — a public database that allows the currency to exist without direct oversight from a single entity, known as a “distributed ledger.” However, Mastercard’s interest in blockchain goes far beyond this single patent. In fact, the company is one of the largest holders of blockchain-related patents in the world. In the last few months,  that allows developers to build new applications on top of its own set of APIs. That helps Mastercard work closer with companies like PayPal and Apple and opens interesting new opportunities that take blockchain even further. Consider the tourism and hospitality industry. Mastercard has developed a platform that would let travelers to plans and personal information privately, and then reap the reward of finding the best deals for their trip. Mastercard has created a program that lets developers build new applications on top of its own set of APIs “Mastercard has recognized the value in the travel industry and are providing a platform that allows holidaymakers/travel seekers and others to tell the tourism world where they wish to go privately through blockchain encryption,” said Stewart. “Airlines, travel companies, hotels and many others will be able to bid to offer that user the best possible price and service over other competing bidding providers, all powered on Mastercard’s blockchain.” It’s a fascinating idea, but tourism is only the tip of the iceberg. Mastercard has a , from sending money, to setting budgets through voice assistants, paying employees instantly and securely, and, most interestingly, something it calls “proof of provenance.” It’s a way of creating a transparent supply chain that both consumers and wholesalers will have access to. That could help both restaurants and ordinary people keep track of where the food on their plate comes from. “Transparency in the supply chain has been something that consumers and wholesalers have been looking for since supply goods began,” said Stewart. “Proof of provenance is the future of knowing where and how goods and services reach the hands of the consumer. Blockchain will be the backbone of this and one major example of this being put into practice will be Amazon utilizing this technology to provide evidence of the supply of their goods. This technology will also reduce loss, damage, theft and time to deliver within any supply chain.” Obviously, Mastercard isn’t the only financial company developing new technology on the blockchain. Competitors like Visa and American Express aren’t far behind, and both have numerous secured patents in the blockchain world. Despite the fact that Mastercard is ahead of the pack, Visa  based in blockchain in August of last year. What it’ll do with these patents is still unclear, but it seems Mastercard won’t be the only player in the game. While we shouldn’t expect financial institutions to embrace cryptocurrency anytime soon, it’s clear our money is going to function a lot more like Bitcoin than dollar bills in the future.",

    "title": "Report Claims Tether Was Used to Artificially Inflate Digital Coin Prices in 2017 | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  stemming from the University of Texas at Austin claims that the big surge in cryptocurrency values during 2017 was artificially created using a digital currency called . Written by finance professor John Griffin and graduate student Amin Shams, the report focuses on , one of the largest unregulated digital currency exchanges on the market. Its owners are also the creators of Tether. he price of a  surged up to $19,549 and then tanked to $6,417 in early February. Since then, Bitcoin’s value has peaked slightly above $11,000 but thereafter continued to take a slow drop to the current price of $6,592. Other cryptocurrencies experienced a similar rise and fall, such as Ethereum skyrocketing to $1,334 on January 10 and then down to the current value of $477. Griffin and Shams examined digital currency exchanges during the highest peaks and noticed unusual activities stemming from Bitfinex. According to the report, patterns indicated that one or more individuals were intentionally pushing digital currency values higher on other exchanges that had sagging prices. To inflate these values, they purchased the low-value cryptocurrency using Tether. For instance, when Bitcoin’s price would fall, purchases used with Tether increased. When Bitcoin would begin to surge, Tether usage didn’t decrease as expected. According to Griffin, the pattern suggests that someone or a group of individuals were purposely using Tether to “protect Bitcoin prices during downturns.” Data used by the research is based on millions of transaction records stored in public ledgers, or blockchains. This data showed that half of the digital coin value spike in 2017 took place within hours after a batch of Tether coins began hitting cryptocurrency exchanges. Coincidentally, Tether entered the exchanges when cryptocurrency prices were plunging. “I’ve looked at a lot of markets,” he said. “If there’s fraud or manipulation in a market it can leave tracks in the data. The tracks in the data here are very consistent with a manipulation hypothesis.” The 66-page paper originally set out to understand how Tether flows through the currency markets. Parent company Tether Ltd. supposedly creates Tether coins in batches of 200 million and moves them to Bitfinex. Currently there are 2.5 billion coins in circulation, and each trades at $1 because each digital coin is backed by $1 stored in a real-world bank. It’s an alternative to the volatile cryptocurrency market while providing the security benefits of digital currency. Naturally Bitfinex denies these allegations. “Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation,” Bitfinex Chief Executive Officer JL van der Velde . “Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.” Bitfinex is registered in a Caribbean jurisdiction but reportedly has offices in Asia. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission  to both Bitfinex and Tether on December 6, 2017 as cryptocurrency values continued to rocket skyward. At the time, Tether said it was hacked and lost around $30 million in digital coins. Tether had yet to provide any proof that it had money in reserve to back its digital currency.",

    "detailContent": " Apple is taking a stance against cryptocurrency mining. The company has updated its developer guidelines to explicitly ban cryptocurrency mining apps on iOS devices. Why? It’s part of wider restrictions against apps that drain battery, generate excessive heat, or strain a device’s resources — all of which take place during cryptocurrency mining. “Apps, including any third-party advertisements displayed within them, may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining,” states the new policy. Here’s a full list of the new guidelines. Of course, developers running ads that exploit device resources to  has been an issue for a while now, and not just on mobile devices. Even  was briefly serving up ads like this for a while, until Google noticed what was happening and banned the ads. Apple’s policy goes a step further, however — it bans mining of any kind, even if the user explicitly wants to use their device for mining. It’s unlikely that the new policy will frustrate miners. iPhones and iPads don’t really possess the processing power to make them good mining devices. That said, it’s possible future devices could possess such power. Thankfully Apple isn’t banning any app related to cryptocurrency mining. As long as the mini process happens off the devices, apps related to the process will still be allowed. On top of that, crypto wallets can still be used on iOS devices. Cryptocurrency mining itself basically involves setting a computer the task of solving equations. To trade bitcoin, transactions are verified through these complex equations, then added to a distributed ledger. In return for solving the equations, miners get bitcoin. Of course, there is a cost associated with mining — electricity costs money, so mining isn’t worth it on many lower-powered computers and devices.",

The stolen currency was a mixture of alt-coins, cryptocurrencies which aren’t as big as the likes of Bitcoin. The hackers managed to steal nearly $20 million worth of NPXS tokens which were issued by Pundi X’s initial coin offering. They also made off with $13.8 million from Aston X which is a company working to create a platform to decentralize documents. Finally, they stole $5.8 million in tokens from Dent and $1.1 million in Tron, a newer currency originating in China. That data comes from the wallet address of the alleged hacker who also managed to get away with smaller amounts of coins from five other cryptocurrencies.

While Coinrail has not commented on the matter of refunds, it has issued a statement addressing the hack. The company has taken its service offline and moved its remaining assets to cold storage while it deals with the matter. Several of the companies whose coins were hacked have also issued statements and pledged to take action against the hacker. Pundi, which says the hacker stole 3 percent of its tokens, has frozen the stolen tokens. It has also ceased all trading of its tokens across various exchanges to help with the investigation which now involves the Korean authorities. NPER, which lost $860,000 in the hack, says it has frozen the stolen coins and plans to incinerate them so the thief will get no value out of them. While the coins may be of no use to the hacker, that is likely to be of little comfort to the victims of this crime. Unfourantely, as is often the case with cryptocurrencies, they have little in the way of legal recourse. The field remains unregulated meaning there is no system to insure these currencies in the event of a theft.",

    "title": "Why a 19-year-old Bitcoin millionaire built a working Dr. Octopus suit | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  What would you do with $3.3 million in the bank? Actually, let us rephrase that: What would you do with $3.3 million in the bank as a 19-year-old kid? If you’re anything like Erik Finman, the answer is simple: you build a robotic suit. But more on that later. If Finman’s name sounds faintly familiar it’s because he is known in certain internet circles for being the world’s youngest  millionaire. He’s that fabled — both fêted and jealously hated — of things: the “early adopter” success story. Aged 12, while most of us were still putting away childish things at middle school, Finman was being introduced to cryptocurrency in a somewhat unlikely way: at an anti-capitalist protest. “My oldest brother took me,” he told Digital Trends. “When we were in the middle of getting tear gassed, I was learning about bitcoin. Bitcoin was revolutionary, it was all about ‘keeping down Wall Street, bro.’” A bit like the countercultural impulse which sparked the early personal computer industry, bitcoin arose out of a distrust of centralized government and politicians’ ability to manage the world. “Couldn’t we do a better job ourselves?” the early bitcoin enthusiasts wondered. And, at least as far as 12-year-old Finman was concerned, yes they could. Bitcoin wasn’t, he said, too difficult to get into at the time, provided that you knew about it. Heck, there were things called bitcoin faucets, which handed out free bitcoin to whoever was interested. Finman was interested, and when his grandmother gave out $1,000 of inheritance money to her grandchildren, he spent it all on the fledgling cryptocurrency; then just three years old. When his grandmother gave out $1,000 of inheritance money to her grandchildren, he spent it all on cryptocurrency. “People knew it would go up, and thought they would make money on it, but they didn’t [necessarily] see it as an investment,” he continued. “People said it would go up to $100 one day, or $200, or $10,000 or $1 million. They’d say that, but they didn’t truly, truly believe that.” Finman likens the belief in bitcoin to our desire for world peace. “You hope for world peace, but you kind of don’t expect it at the same time.”   A post shared by  (@erikfinman) on  Before long bitcoin was everything to Finman. He hated school and his teachers. “School just wasn’t for me,” he said. “I had one teacher who told me to drop out and go work in McDonald’s, because that was all I was going to amount to in life.” Eventually he dropped out altogether, although he didn’t immediately take up the job of short-order fry cook. Instead, he spent hours studying bitcoin’s fluctuations online. When he started out, a single bitcoin cost around $10. His $1,000 therefore gave him 100 bitcoins, which he worked hard to grow to hundreds of coins. “It was like in a video game where you’re trying to collect more and more points. I was collecting more and more coin.” Aged 15, he sold around $100,000 worth of bitcoin and started an online business, linking up different thinking students like himself with virtual teachers around the world. Naturally, his new business accepted bitcoin as payment. And the collection grew. So did the valuation: creeping up all the time as more and more folks started to hear about it. “When it went up to $20, I was excited,” Finman said. “When it hit $100 and then $300, those were huge milestones. That was a fun time. It was unstoppable.” At its height, on 15 December 2017, a single bitcoin reached $17,900. (Its price quickly dropped by one-third in 24 hours, and today is around the $8,200 mark.) At present, Finman owns 401 bitcoins, which carries a current value of just under $3.3 million. Finman made an agreement with his parents — both of whom hold Ph.Ds — that if he had made his first million by 18 he wouldn’t have to go to college. He did, so he didn’t. Instead, he did what plenty of young brash internet-savvy rich kids would do. He travelled. He took part in a  and gave a TedX talk. He was the subject of articles for websites like  with titles such as “.” He  stepping off private jets or lounging on a bed covered in dollar bills like a figurative mashup of characters from  and . When “haters” complained about the latter photo, he dismissed the picture as “sarcastic and satirical,” and  saying that, “I’m sorry for posting photos on a bed of dollars intead of a pile of bitcoin.” Which is to say, it wasn’t an apology at all. He cultivated a personality online that was one part Elon Musk, one part gangsta rap cliché, one part , and the remainder one of those unskippable YouTube ads featuring a guy with expensive cars lined up in the background, talking about how you (yes, you!) can turn your life by following his example. But this is where the robot suit comes into it and, with it, what hints at the maturation of Erik Finman. The suit, which is really more of a wearable robotic prostheses, is modeled on the four-armed contraption belonging to Doctor Octopus in the  comics. The idea is that these highly advanced mechanical arms can give their wearer the ability to augment their abilities with the addition of four extra limbs. Finman’s exosuit was created using 3D printing, with the arms controlled via rear-mounted microcontrollers and eight motors which power the thing; driving its arms and allowing it to lift objects. The user controls the arms using the two middle fingers on each hand, fitted into a glove which allow all four arms to be manipulated on multiple axis. But, crucially, this wasn’t created for Finman. It was made for a 10-year-old kid named Aristou Meehan. Meehan is the son of one of Finman’s mentors, who suffers from hypermobility issues. “He was incredibly strong because of that,” he said. “He came up with this idea — because he’s a huge comic book fan, a huge  fan — of having his own Doctor Octopus suit. He said that would solve my problems. I thought that was such a smart idea and sweet. For me, it would have been so great if someone had helped me at that age. So I felt like a kindred spirit in a lot of ways.” Finman invested some of his bitcoin money in building the suit, and worked with a “ragtag team of engineers” to make it a reality. Meehan couldn’t have been more thrilled with the result, which he debuted at Comic-Con to much acclaim. Right now, it’s not exactly practical as more than a tech demo (although Finman makes a point of noting that it’s made Meehan “incredibly popular at school”). However, he hopes to expand the project into a more practical device which could be used in a variety of different ways. “Right now, it’s like a concept car,” he said. “But I’ve been talking with a lot of people who are interested in doing more with it.” He is additionally planning on open-sourcing the design in the near future. Finman has also bought back his old company , the one he sold at 15 years old, and aims to make it into a leading education platform. What could be better than helping out other kids to get the education they deserve? So is the self-styled teen bitcoin bad boy turning good? Perhaps. Ultimately, Erik Finman casts a light on the intriguing next generation of hopeful entrepreneurs: an internet-savvy iGen representative whose vision of success is a blend of  and, well, Jäger shots. Will the former increasingly outweigh the latter in terms of his priorities? Under the overcompensating bombast, Finman is a smart guy with his heart in the right place. We think so, and the evidence is hopefully beginning to mount that it will. Under the overcompensating bombast, Finman is a smart guy with his heart in the right place — and the brains and resources to make a lot of his dreams happen. Even if, secretly, his story just makes us wish we’d invested in bitcoin back in the day!",

    "detailContent": " Niche cryptocurrency ZenCash has been hit by a “51 percent attack,” leading to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tokens. Although problematic in its own right, the attack highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin — computing power. Blockchain backed cryptocurrencies like , are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ () say is true. It’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power. While that might be difficult for a platform like Bitcoin where there are thousands upon thousands of high-powered mining rigs, it’s much easier to trick smaller cryptocurrency networks. That is exactly what happened with ZenCash, where over a period of four hours, attackers used masses of computing power to take control of the blockchain and create alternate histories, thereby letting them spend their ZenCash twice. Because the attackers covered their tracks, no one quite knows what they did with it, but no doubt it was profitable. looks at the hash rate, or global computing power currently mining different cryptocurrencies, and how much a 51 percent attack would technically cost to perform if rented from existing networks. In the case of ZenCash, the attacker would theoretically only have had to spend around $30,000 to complete the double-spend hack. Blockchain networks like Bitcoin, which are far larger, would require a much greater expenditure to complete a 51 percent attack — $717,000 for just one hour, according to Crypto51. Fortunately, there isn’t enough rental power in the world to conduct such an attack, but if an organization was to get a hold of enough hashing power, those currencies are just as vulnerable and could be attacked in much the same way. ZenCash isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has been hit with a 51 percent attack. As , both Bitcoin Gold and Verge have both been hit in a similar manner in recent months. They required less hashing power than ZenCash, so it’s possible that this latest attack is just another example if a trend of upward trajectory attacks that target much more vulnerable cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms. Fifty-one percent attacks aren’t the only problems faced by Bitcoin and public blockchain platforms, though, .",

    "detailContent": " If you find yourself taking the “hold on for dear life,” or HODL, stance toward cryptocurrency , and can’t help yourself when it comes to buying cryptocurrency, you may be addicted. That’s the view of experts at the Scotland-based Castle Craig Hospital, which expanded its rehab services to cover cryptocurrency addiction earlier this month. Experts have long compared the thrill of cryptocurrency to day trading, both of which entail high degrees of risk. You’re essentially gambling with your money with crypto and with day trading, and the thrill of massive returns — and the potential addictive effects — create an emotional dependence that is not much different from gambling addiction. “The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler,” Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn says. “It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains \u0026 losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.” Similar to those that might be addicted to casino table games or slots, the addicted trader spends most if not all of their money on cryptocurrency, and will “chase” their losses in attempts to win back lost money. They may borrow excessively or even steal, or experience mood swings and obsessive thoughts and actions, . Castle Craig plans to treat addicts using the same methods used for excessive gambling. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary tool, and teaches the person how to accept responsibility for their addiction and coping strategies, finding positive activities to replace the need for cryptocurrency trading, and most importantly how to manage their debts and finances appropriately. The help is not cheap: according to , Treatments start at 2,975 British pounds (about $4,000) per week for a multi-occupancy room all the way up to 4,970 pounds (about $6,600) weekly for a private room. Considering most addiction programs are multi-step processes — Castle Craig’s is 12 — treatment could easily run into the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. While most won’t be able to afford the treatment out-of-pocket, the company says it offers payment plans, and in some cases a portion of the cost might be covered under public or private insurance. The company also operates clinics in at least six other European countries, however it’s not immediately clear if the program will be offered at those locations.",

    "detailContent": " From June 14 to July 15, the attention of sports fans across the globe will mainly be focused on one thing — the  in Russia. As usual with this event, more than a billion people will be cheering on their favorite teams while simultaneously making bold predictions as part of the official . But this year, those who have a knack for picking the winning teams could also earn themselves a bit of cryptocurrency as well, potentially cashing in on the current crypto craze to take home some serious cash. A website called  is hosting a bracket challenge of its own, with all entrants earning a digital token based 0n their picks for the outcome of the World Cup games. Those tokens are generated as part of the  blockchain, which means they will hold a certain value on cryptocurrency trading networks based on the current price of Ethereum itself. That value can — and likely will — fluctuate up and down throughout the month-long World Cup tournament. While that tournament is taking place, the token will gain points based on the number of games that its owner has picked correctly. Those who accurately predict the outcome of the games will shoot up the Cryptocup leaderboards, putting them in position to take home a slice of the prize money. The goal is to be in the top 10 percent when the tournament ends, as those players will split the purse, which will have its value determined by the number of players who have entered the contest and the current value of Ethereum. The organizers of the Cryptocup tournament say that roughly 25 percent of the money collected will go toward paying the website’s overhead throughout the tournament. The remainder will be split among the top 10 percent of the players, with the exception of a small consolation payout going to the player who finishes in last place overall. But there is another element to the Cryptocup game that makes it even more intriguing. In addition to the token gaining points based on how well the owner predicts the outcome of the World Cup games, that same token can be  on a secondary trading market that will spring up around the website. This gives players the opportunity to sell their token and cash out early should they find someone interested in buying it. Similarly, would-be buyers can look to cash in on a potentially valuable token by making an offer to its owner. All transactions of this type will be subject to a five percent commission, which will also be added to the prize money. Currently, the pot is valued at 19.5 ETH, which equates to about $11,150. The current buy-in for those who want to take part in the Cryptocup tournament is .075 ETH or approximately $42. That price will increase as we near the start of the World Cup, potentially fueling an even bigger purse and payout down the line. To find out more and join in on the fun, visit the .",

    "title": "Justice Department Now Investigating Cryptocurrency Traders for Fraud | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The U.S. Department of Justice is now working with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to  to determine if cryptocurrency traders are manipulating prices using illegal practices. The news arrives by way of four unnamed people close to the federal probe who state that the private investigation is now underway and in its early stages. According to the sources, federal prosecutors are determining if traders are using a tactic called spoofing, which is the act of flooding the market with fake orders to increase demand and drive prices upward, and then canceling those orders. Another tactic is wash trading where a cheater trades with himself/herself to artificially inflate market demand, driving up prices. The lure of cryptocurrency is that it’s not tied to any bank or government. At the same time, digital coins are not regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thus traders are essentially on their own, unprotected against a Wild West-like market. There is no real guarantee that cryptocurrency exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, and there are no means of recovering lost monies stemming from fake cryptocurrency startups. A good example of the current cryptocurrency woes is the initial coin offering (ICO). Companies promising to launch a new cryptocurrency platform will offer “valuable” tokens in exchange for early investments — something akin to Kickstarter where projects enlist financial backers that receive a product in the end. In this case, cryptocurrency startups are disappearing with the cash instead of launching their digital coin platforms. By March, these ICO-related scams reached to the point that  to crack down on companies, lawyers, and advisory firms promoting these ICOs. The government agency believes all virtual currencies should be listed as securities — a tradable financial asset that gains worth over time — and registered with regulators. There are securities laws in place to protect investors against fraud. Despite the growing interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the market is considered volatile. For instance, a single Bitcoin was worth $6,897 on November 6, 2017, skyrocketed to $17,549 just over a month later, then dropped back down to $7,964 at the beginning of February. Since then, the value of a Bitcoin has experienced rises and drops resembling mountain peaks. The current Bitcoin slump reportedly stems from nations such as Japan and the Philippines now regulating cryptocurrency. China is banning cryptocurrency exchanges altogether. Even more,  and  are banning cryptocurrency-related advertisements from their ad networks due to the unregulated, volatile nature of digital currency and the related scams.  ",

    "title": "How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Mining Take? Experts Are Unsure | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " How much energy does crypto mining really use? One  conducted by Alex de Vries says that Bitcoin mining consumes 24 THw of energy or as much as Ireland. To make matters worse, the study estimates that Bitcoin’s energy use is doubling every six months. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin could use as much as 67 THw or the annual energy consumption of the Czech Republic. While those numbers might seem high, things may . For starters, one of the main issues with  is that it was originally powered in large part by coal plants in China. In recent years, however, China has worked to rein in its pollution problem, and many Bitcoin mining operations have moved to countries which make use of cleaner energy. Another issue is the matter of distribution. Comparing Bitcoin’s energy usage to countries such as Ireland or the Czech Republic is useful to help visualize the scope of their operations, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Bitcoin mining can happen from anywhere in the world so no one country’s infrastructure is bearing the brunt of the cost. Beyond that, there are numerous experts who dispute this study’s findings. Jonathan Koomey, a professor at Stanford who, in the 1990s, disproved similar fears about the internet, says there simply isn’t enough data available to draw conclusions. “For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,”. “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.” One of the issues Koomey points out is that it is difficult to determine how the value of the energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for that energy. He is unsure of where de Vries is getting the two numbers he uses for those values. “The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” said Koomey. “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.” The other issue is the accessibility of Bitcoin data. Many Bitcoin miners are concerned about their privacy which can make it difficult to accurately determine how much energy is used. The mining of  does consume a fair amount of energy, but it’s unclear as to exactly how much.",

    "title": "Rising Energy Cost Could Make Bitcoin Mining Unprofitable | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Energy consumption required to mine for Bitcoin may soon become too expensive for cryptocurrency mining to become profitable. It’s estimated that cryptocurrency mining can consume as much as 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by the end of this year, according to economist . “The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts),” de Vries said. “Economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.” Using a series of mathematical models that take hardware, electricity, and cooling costs into account, de Vries was able to approximate total energy consumption using upstream chip production numbers. In the past, more accurate energy estimates were not possible because of the secretive nature of  facilities, which keep their operations behind closed doors. So much energy is required in mining because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Because cryptocurrency relies on a peer-to-peer network to keep records of transactions, energy is needed to power large distributed networks of computers. “Those computers collectively perform quintillions of calculations per second, each “mining,” trying to solve a math problem that will give it the right to form the next block on the chain,”  said of the process. “And the winner every 10 minutes is rewarded with 12.5 Bitcoins. That’s more than $100,000 at the coin’s current exchange rates.” To capitalize on the rewards, miners need to have facilities with numerous computers dedicated to mining, and these computers generate heat. In addition to the energy consumed to mine, these systems also require a significant amount of energy for cooling. In the past, it was  could power your home for an entire week. To help offset some of the cooling costs, operations like  want to locate mining facilities in cooler climates, like in Sweden. Another startup is using the heat generated from mining to  as an alternative to using energy to cool mining facilities. Because of the high cost associated with mining, a university researcher misappropriated the institution’s hardware and electricity to obtain $8,000 to $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, which incurred a total cost of approximately $150,000. In another example, a mining facility in Russia was suspended for not paying for several million kilowatt-hours of electricity. As a result of rising cost, malicious agents may be motivated to steal energy for their own mining operations. However, there will still be some who will continue to mine for Bitcoin at a loss, and those people may be motivated by ” libertarian ideology (supporting a payment network that does not rely on a central authority), or speculative reasons.” As energy costs continue to rise, cryptocurrency mining may no longer be a profitable enterprise.",

    "detailContent": " German businessman Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that will use Bitcoin to facilitate international money transfers. Albrecht says that Bitbond’s use of cryptocurrency will allow it to transfer money quicker and at a lower cost than standard banks. “Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” he told Reuters. “With Bitbond, . Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Clients who use Bitbond only hold onto the cryptocurrencies for a few minutes before they are exchanged for local currency. This ensures that clients won’t have to deal with the rather volatile cryptocurrency market. Bitbond was founded in 2013 and has grown into an officially licensed bank with a large number of investors. Currently, Bitbond’s Berlin office employs 24 people from a dozen countries managing loans for about 100 clients. In total, the loans amount to about $1 million each month. Albrecht says that the majority of his customers are small business owners or freelance workers who need a quick and affordable way to handle international loans. The loans are fairly small by the standards of most banks, and tend to be around $50,000 at the higher end of the scale. While Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans in the past, this is the first time that it has been used to facilitate international loans. It makes sense that Germany would be one of the first countries to attempt it, however. Adoption of Bitcoin has proceeded at a rapid rate within Germany. In terms of Bitcoin usage, it is second only to the United States. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just now beginning to hit the mainstream, they still pose many risks not found in traditonal currencies. The largest is the simple fact that the various currencies tend to sharply fluctuate in value. This can make it risky as a long-term investment, but since Bitbond clients only hold the cryptocurrencies for a short amount of time, that risk is mitigated to some extent.

In the last quarter alone, Nvidia estimated that almost 10 percent of Nvidia’s revenue came from cryptocurrency miners and that doesn’t even factor in cards bought by miners under the guise of being high-end gamers. We’ve been covering the unprecedented spikes in  pricing for the past year and documented how most mainstream cards were priced far beyond what gamers could afford to pay.  for buying up much of the stock and  suggests that could well have been the case. With near $290 million in sales to miners in the last quarter alone, Nvidia has made a lot of money from miners buying its graphics cards. Overall Nvidia’s revenue reached $3.21 billion in the first quarter of the 2019 financial year, a rise of 66 percent over a year ago. That can be broken down into several key areas. Hardware sold for rendering purposes made up $250 million, while automotive graphics purchases topped $145 million, and datacenter sales hit a new high of $700 million. “OEM and IP” sales accounted for $387 million, but gaming still made up the largest portion of Nvidia’s revenue stream, reaching $1.723 billion, but Nvidia did say that may not be entirely accurate. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, said in an interview that there was no accounting for cryptocurrency miners who purchased gaming cards from retailers, as there is no stipulation that they need to be forthcoming about what they were buying the cards for. There’s also no telling how many ‘gamers’ also used their cards for mining in their downtime, as . “There is no way to tell [how many gamer cards were sold to miners] because a lot of gamers when they aren’t playing games, they’re doing a little mining,” Huang told . “The reason why they bought it is for gaming, but while they’re not gaming — while they’re at school, at work, or in bed — they’ll turn it on and do a little mining. There’s nothing wrong with that, I think that’s fine, but the real reason why they bought it is for gaming.”",

After announcing KodakOne during the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, owner of the image rights management platform Wenn Digital has now achieved funding for KodakCoin. KodakCoin will launch on May 21, followed by the KodakOne platform sometime during late 2018. KodakOne uses  — protecting data through a large network of computers — and applies the concept to managing photo rights. The company calls it an “encrypted digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers.” Photographers can add new images as well as archive images to the system. Because of the blockchain structure, the data is stored on a large network of computers that helps create a public ledger, adds a layer of protection, and prevents data loss. While the blockchain keeps the record of photographs, crawler bots will search the web for those photos, Kodak said. Licensed images will be linked to an IP address, so bots won’t incorrectly flag purchased images. If that crawler detects an image that wasn’t properly licensed, Kodak says the platform assists photographers in getting those sites to license the image. “For many in the tech industry, ‘blockchain’ and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem,” Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said in a statement. “Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.” Along with serving as a platform for photographers to help find and recover stolen images, KodakOne will also function as a licensing platform where photographers can sell their work. Kodak said the platform pays in KodakCoin immediately after the sale and is ideal for both professional and amateur photographers. After KodakCoin’s initial offering launched on January 31 in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and other select countries, KodakCoin announced on May 10 that it will price the Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFT) at $1.00 starting on May 21. The successful SAFT funding will allow KodakCoin to launch in the next few weeks. Wenn Digital says that KodakCoin is facilitated by Cointopia with management from Pickwick Capital Partners LLC and Exemplar Capital LLC. Both firms are FINRA members and the broker-dealers are registered with the SEC. “We are excited to offer the SAFTs and the rights to the underlying KodakCoin in a manner structured to fully comply with an exemption to the SEC’s registration requirements,” Jan Denecke, CEO of Wenn Digital, said in a statement. “Our goal with this offering is utmost security and transparency, working to bring digital tokens to investors by adhering to industry best practices and in a manner that we hope instills public confidence in the crypto space.” Photographers can learn more about the company’s plans for a blockchain-protected rights management network at the .

But shortly after  went live, three of the five GeForce GTX 10 Series cards sold out: The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti ($699), the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti ($449), and the GTX 1060 ($299). At the time of this writing, Nvidia still had supplies of the GeForce GTX 1080 ($549) and the vanilla GeForce GTX 1070 ($399). Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050 Ti and 1050 desktop graphics are only sold through .  prices have been crazy for the past year, often reaching heights of two or even three times the launch price of the hardware. While there are a lot of , Nvidia has at least offered cards directly to consumers at a much more reasonable cost. Those cards have always been snapped up quickly, and the latest depletion of Nvidia’s stock is a prime example. Still, are we starting to get clear of the pricing and availability issues that have plagued consumer graphics cards sales for the past year? It may also be an indication of people preferring to wait for the expected impending debut of Nvidia’s next-generation . Whether they’re called Volta or Turing, , it’s likely that we’ll see some sort of official announcement in the next month or two. Unfortunately, Geforce GTX 10 Series cards are still on sale at much higher prices through third-party sellers on platforms like Newegg and Amazon.  close to $1,000 and GTX 1070s are still on sale for $500-plus, despite recent falls in pricing across the internet. We can’t say for sure how long this latest batch of stock will last, when Nvidia will refresh its stock again, or whether the recent resurgence of some cryptocurrency values will lead to further shortages later this year. But what we do know is that graphics cards are finally available at reasonable prices again. It may not be true forever, but it is true for now.",

    "detailContent": " Facebook’s leadership tree looks a bit different today as the company re-arranges employees in a move both to enhance security and to create a new branch researching blockchain technology. The change doesn’t remove employees but gives the social media giant top executives some new roles. News of the shift , but Facebook has .  CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains at the head of the company, but the change creates three different divisions inside the company’s internal structure, according to Recode. The first holds the company’s entire division of apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and will be lead by Chris Cox, who moves into a role as chief product officer after heading up the  app. Kevin Systrom hasn’t shifted as the CEO for Instagram, but Chris Daniels, previously the company’s vice president for the Internet.org efforts, is heading up WhatsApp while previous product head at Messenger Stan Chudnovsky will lead the Messenger app team. Will Cathcart is taking over leadership for the  app division. The second division in the executive shift is the most notable even for Facebook fans indifferent to the who’s who because the change creates a new team for privacy alongside a group for researching blockchain. Along with those new divisions, this new division for platforms and infrastructure also includes Facebook’s efforts in augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the Workplace app. Facebook’s team focused on privacy is new inside that second division — but it’s not difficult to see why the company is building more focus on privacy and policy. Along with facing the fall out over the , the company is facing increased regulation from legislation like  and  as well. Jay Parikh, one of Facebook’s executives on the engineering team, will be heading that new team. Another result of the shift is that Facebook now has a team dedicated to researching . Blockchain has quickly become a buzzword — and many joke that just a mention of the word increases stock prices. While the technology is most often associated with cryptocurrency, blockchain, boiled down to the basics, is about placing data on multiple locations and connecting those locations. With the data spread over multiple locations, the data is easy to verify and more complicated to hack. The setup also prevents a single person from controlling all that data. Outside of confirming the staffing changes — and a comment from Zuckerberg earlier this year about looking into the technology — Facebook hasn’t said exactly how blockchain would be used in the company and  That hasn’t stopped speculation about potential uses for blockchain within , however, from security and  to tracking . David Marcus, the company’s previous lead for Messenger, will be leading the new blockchain team. Marcus has previous experience working for PayPal and serves as a board member for Coinbase. The third division in the executive shift is for central product services, led by Javier Olivan, who previously worked in the company’s growth team. The division includes teams for ads, security, and growth, Recode says. Additional shifts include moving Facebook’s News Feed head Adam Mosseri over to Instagram as the vice president of product.",

    "title": "Volition – The Blockchain Card Game That You Print At Home | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Imagine a world where card gaming didn’t involve shipping millions of cards all over the world, where cards could be downloaded and printed at home, and ownership was maintained by a ledger accessible and readable by every player. That’s what  is designed to be. Its developers want to create a new paradigm that allows everything from digital card distribution, to permanent card upgrades, and even sanctioned custom fan artwork — all facilitated by the blockchain.  and  are card gaming’s most influential franchises, so it’s no surprise Volition is looking to them for inspiration. “[] lands itself between  and  in terms of complexity, difficulty and learning curve,” Ken Pilcher, lead game designer of , told Digital Trends. “It’s going to be resource based, so you’re going to play around with resources that will unlock higher level cards that you can use – characters and creatures that you attack your opponent with directly.” Both Pilcher and Patrick Meehan, fellow co-founder of developer Crytogogue, previously worked on award-winning collectible card game . They’re looking to leverage that experience in a new way with . “You can print it on demand, print it from your home, or send over the files to a professional.” “There’s no turn order, you just have the start of your turn, take it, and then end it,” Pilcher continued. “Also, it’s action based. You’ll have three actions [so] it’s going to be limited in that regard. That’s kind of the resource system. It’s actions, rather than  or  mana.” They hope to make a game that’s accessible to as wide an audience as possible – as  was designed to be. Yet they want greater complexity and nuance, so there’s more depth for experienced players to enjoy.  is built on a custom blockchain that will give the game unique features the developers hope will revolutionize collectible card games. There truly hasn’t been anything like it before. The blockchain is not an easy topic to wrap your head around, even with  — but in a nutshell, it’s a decentralized digital ledger that tracks everything about a digital token. While  tracks monetary transactions, the  blockchain would track cards. It would keep a record of who owns which cards, and what changes are made to them. That means the physical cards are not what’s important.  is instead based on digital cards, which are then printed for real-world play. “You mine or purchase booster packs from others who have mined them, pick your cards, build your deck, and print them out from a PDF that will be generated,” Pilcher explained. “You can print it on demand, print it from your home, or send over the files to a more professional printers to get higher quality versions of the cards.” Where traditional card games have decks built from physical cards purchased from retailers,  is as decentralized as the blockchain it’s based upon. The cards will come from booster packs generated by miners. As with cryptocurrencies like  to validate transactions that take place. Every time people trade cards, buy new cards, or change cards (more on that later), those changes require validation, and the miners will be responsible for that. The reward? New booster packs. Each card will have a glyph or QR code on it, so you can tell the ownership of the card and look into its history. Those boosters can then be opened by the miner or traded to someone else. Whichever option they go with, the results will once again be recorded on the blockchain. As with real collectible cards, there will be a limited number of them from each “print” run — especially the rarer cards. “Each card will have a glyph or QR code on it, so you can tell the ownership of the card and look into its history,” explained Pilcher, highlighting how  would handle people playing with cards that they don’t “own.” However, Cryptogouge isn’t too worried about unsanctioned play. That’s theoretically possible with any CCG, and any sanctioned tournament play would require deck-checks against the blockchain. “Once you start thinking about the assets as being digital, then the cardboard just kind of becomes an embodiment,” Meehan told Digital Trends. “I want people to rethink their relationship with card stock. Why have a warehouse of cards and ship it across the world if the assets can be painlessly and permanently stored in the ledger? Card stock is dead, long live card stock. Cryptogogue isn’t the first company to try and , and with its very hands-off approach, it will need to craft a system that’s fair, secure, and can sidestep the . “We’re going for a custom protocol for a lot of reasons,” Meehan said when asked about the blockchain Cryptogogue is leveraging. “It took us a long time to get to that decision, and we had to do a lot of research.” Cryptogogue wants the mining aspect of  to be something gamers themselves can be involved in throughout the life of the game. outlines the basic underpinning of the game’s blockchain, and the developers say even more details will be added in the future. It has a functioning blockchain already in operation with miners who’ve signed up to beta-test. The developers are keen to avoid scale problems, because they long transaction times could frustrate players and send the entire project into a tail-spin. “It’s a little early for me to get too detailed, but I will say that I think for a blockchain to be scalable, the notion of sharding has to be built in from the ground up,” Meehan said. Sharding involves splitting up a blockchain into more manageable chunks, so miners only process a certain part of it. In theory, that reduces the security of a blockchain because a single miner with incredibly powerful hardware might be able to take over too much of the validation process. That’s something the Cryptogogue team is working to avoid. “One guy with  could just own your chain in a naive proof of work algorithm [and] we’re taking a lot of precautions to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Meehan said. “We’re going to be careful that the mining is accessible. It won’t be super advanced for getting it going, but you’ll need some kind of beginner or intermediate IT skills. We’re going to take care not to do things where you need to sink money into custom hardware. [We want it] to be accessible through work rather than a load of money.” Pilcher echoed these sentiments, saying that he wanted the mining aspect of  to be something gamers themselves can be involved in throughout the life of the game. In comparison, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, to a lesser extent, have seen professionals with thousands or even . Cryptogogue wants to keep its miners more grounded than that, even if the practice should be slightly profitable to encourage node creation. Alongside card trades and booster pack purchases, miners will be charged with validating card upgrades and augmentations. Since the cards in  are digital entities, they can be altered permanently in ways that physical cards cannot. Certain cards can be combined, augmenting or upgrading the original character or item to something new and more powerful, with all changes recorded on the blockchain. While that offers an exciting potential for the types of cards we’ll see in different players’ decks, the most intriguing effect of the upgrade system is how it might alter the rarity of cards. “If you take a card and attach another card to it, the original attaching card is effectively destroyed from the ledger,” Pilcher explained to Digital Trends. “That will create rarity and scarcity just from people combining cards. That will be another interesting tool from a design standpoint.” It’s not just the stats and abilities of cards that can change through upgrades and augmentation.  Cryptogogue will also allow visual customization of cards, letting artists and fans craft their own card art. While that’s something anyone could do with any CCG by printing custom cards at home,  uses the blockchain to validate the changes, making them official. “Well, we’ll see what happens when you walk into a game shop with cards covered in inappropriate art.” That’s still a work in progress. “There’s a continuum of possibilities there and a lot of that will be informed by how the community grows,” Meehan said. “There’s everything from kind of the ‘wild west,’ put whatever you want on a card, to something more gated with a little process for leveraging the crowd to identify ideas that might be perfect. There are plenty of things we can do to ultimately give them value.” If Cryptogogue were to opt for the ‘wild west’ scenario, we asked the developers how they planned to implement effective guidelines for what is and isn’t appropriate. What would stop someone from defacing cards with genitalia? “Well, we’ll see what happens when you walk into a gameshop with cards covered in inappropriate art,” Meehan laughed. “You’re going to learn a lesson in consequences.” Pilcher also suggested because cards have real value, it’d be unlikely for people to want to deface them entirely, as a card with terrible or offensive art – even a unique one – would be likely to lose value because of it. The reverse of that might be celebrity or professional players who sign cards, or perform some other form of customization, before selling them on, increasing the value of a card through their ownership of it. As for parental controls, Cryptogogue is investigating the idea of “constrained wallets” so parents can look at the logs of their children’s’ play and actions, as well as leverage built-in filtering.  will be paired with its own cryptocurrency, VOL. When the game launches, VOL will be a secondary payment method for more established cryptocurrencies, used only when trading for new boosters and cards. The developers hope that in the future, VOL will be the preferred method of monetary compensation within the game world. VOL, will be a secondary payment method for other, more traditional cryptocurrencies, used only when trading for new boosters and cards. “We think [VOL] will eventually be the preferred currency because it will be faster and more secure,” Meehan explained. “We’re not going to gate it on costs, or transaction fees of other protocols, but we’re also trying integrations. To on-board people we think they’re going to want to use currencies they’re already familiar with, so we’re taking the hybrid approach with the anticipation that people will want to eventually transact in VOL.” With any cryptocurrency, the question arises — how do you get it into the hands of the players? In the case of VOL, Cryptogogue is keen to avoid an initial coin offering (ICO), which is often seen as a quick cash grab. “We’re still weighing the options and we’re going to see what the community wants to do,” Meehan said. “We’re shying away from doing an ICO, so there may be other ways to distribute the currency. It may also be part of a mining reward. It may be something we’ll leave up to the miners. We’ll see.” The  team still has time to figure that, and other aspects of the game, out. It’s not planned for a general release until later this year, though early testers will begin playing the game this summer. A mining technology beta is slated to begin in late summer, and that’s where  blockchain will be put through its paces. The developers hope they can do more than just create a new game and a new cryptocurrency. They hope to ride the wave of board game resurgence and pioneer not only a new way to play, but a new way to publish games. “We think this is really a new genre of game, and we’re approaching this with a very creative and experimental mindset, and hope to prove the model,” Meehan said. “We would love to see a whole new era of games and a whole new way of publishing games come out of this. It’s cards today, but with 3D printers and models, we’ll see. It’s a really exciting experiment –and  we think it’s going to be a lot of fun.”",

    "detailContent": " Malware miners managed to infect more than 400 big websites recently, resulting in the generation of large quantities of cryptocurrency for the attackers. The cryptojackers appear to have taken advantage of a flaw in content management system (CMS) Drupal to install the stealthy mining software under the nose of website owners. Cryptojacking, the process of running cryptocurrency mining software on someone’s system without them realizing it, has become a hot trend in recent months. It even  as one of the top go-to methods for making money with malware. Although not as impactful to affected victims as ransomware or identity theft, it can still cause slowdowns on a system and potentially damage hardware if allowed to run rampant. This latest cryptojacking craze has been termed “Drupalgeddon 2” by those who discovered it at  It saw the hackers infiltrate websites that were running outdated and vulnerable versions of the Drupal CMS to install the cryptomining software Coinhive, as per . Although designed to allow website owners to monetize their users in ways other than advertising, Coinhive has been used by hackers to take advantage of vulnerable websites and their unwitting users. A subsequent visit to sites affected by this latest attack forced visitors to run the software, generating cryptocurrency for the hackers. Affected sites included PC manufacturer Lenovo, the San Diego Zoo, and the government website for Chihuahua, Mexico. Some of these have now patched up the holes and removed the Coinhive software, . The flaw that allowed the hackers to take advantage of this has been known about since March and Drupal has been updated by the developers since. However, not all websites have installed the necessary patches, which has left many vulnerable. Although 400-plus sites were infected in this latest attack, with more than a million sites using the CMS globally, there is real potential for further attacks of increased scope. If you’re interested in mining cryptocurrencies yourself — legally — know that it’s far from easy to turn a profit. If you have cheap electricity and enough investment funds though, it is possible. .

Games from Space promises to provide users with many big-name titles for free, provided they’re willing to loan their GPU’s power. “With a simple software we use the performance of graphics cards for complex computing tasks and pay the temporary loan of graphical processing power with pre-selected games,” Games from Space said in a press release. “The user is not restricted in the daily use of his computer. Even while working on the computer, streaming, or watching YouTube, the  can run separately.” Should you need your computer’s GPU for something else during this time, the program will automatically halt, so you shouldn’t see any decreased performance.

The energy needed to have your GPU running for hours at a time will likely cause your electricity bill to soar through the roof, and it could stress your system more quickly than if you were using it normally. We wrote last month about similar marketplace called , which offers blockchain-based tokens but operates a little differently. Through the service, you can choose to mine for cryptocurrency and purchase games from the marketplace, but it also allows for the reselling of digital games.

    "title": "AMD Blamed For Rumored Ban On ASRock Graphics Cards In Europe | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " AMD may be blocking all sales of ASRock graphics cards within key territories like Europe, though the exact reasoning for this move is as yet unknown. The ban is said to extend throughout the entire new ASRock “Phantom” range though, with  supposedly banned from sale in Europe. ASRock’s bread and butter business is motherboards, but it announced in March that it had partnered with AMD to release its own brand of , too. Dodging the ongoing controversy of Nvidia’s pseudo-exclusive, and , ASRock planned to exclusively sell AMD cards instead, but it may not be doing so in Europe. This story first reared its head in a review of one of ASRock’s RX 580 Phantom Gaming X cards on the . While the reviewer praised the hardware, especially considering it is one of ASRock’s first-ever graphics cards, the card was not handed over from a traditional source. Indeed ASRock reportedly inquired as to where it was acquired, as no review samples had been sent to the E.U. region. In further comments, ASRock confirmed that the cards would only be sold in South America and in Pacific regions, like Russia, Australia, Japan, and the U.S. — though excluding China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The reasoning for this is said to be “based on the history of mutual channel agreement,” according to the Toms Hardware source. How acceptable such a ban on sales is with ASRock though, isn’t entirely clear. A number of rumors surround the reasoning, though a  source suggests that it could relate to the several AMD-only brands already operating out of Europe and a desire from AMD to see a wider variety of sellers in other regions. However, considering the recent reports of China being excluded from planned sales zones, early rumors suggesting that ASRock was targeting the Asian market seem unfounded. Another suggestion is that as  across the globe, AMD is keen on limiting sales to markets with the lowest stock levels at this time. We’ll no doubt learn more as ASRock cards hit the digital shelves of online retailers in the near future.",

    "title": "What is Sweatcoin and How Does it Work? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Whether you’re seeking motivation to be more active or you’re  who wouldn’t mind a few extra perks for working out, Sweatcoin is a great way to earn rewards for moving your body. That said, there’s always a lot of confusion about anything dealing with digital currency (aka ) — let alone the actual app and its functions. Bogged down with arcane terms like cryptocurrency and blockchain, it can seem more complicated than it is. Get past the perplexing vocabulary, however, and Sweatcoin is actually fairly straightforward. To help sift through the jargon, we’ve put together this simple explainer. As mentioned above,  is digital currency you earn by being active. To accumulate it, you first need to download the Sweatcoin app and keep it running on your phone at all times. Any time you walk or run outside, it tracks your steps and pays you in sweatcoins (SWC). For every 1,000 steps you take, you earn just under 1 SWC. After accumulating enough SWC, you’re then able to redeem them for items like sports watches, Amazon credits, music downloads, e-Books, airline miles, or gift certificates to various retailers. Offers constantly changed and are largely based on whatever deals Sweatcoin has made with various retailers. These transactions are all viewable via the Sweatcoin app — available for free on both iOS and , although you can use your sweatcoins to upgrade to different subscription levels. There are a few limitations to the app, however. First, to amass SWC, you have to be running or walking — the activity tracking is based solely on steps, so riding your bike or swimming is not going to earn any coins. You also have to be outside to accrue SWC which means running on a treadmill or doing stairs at the gym won’t count either — although some reports say it records steps around the house. The reason for this restriction is to avoid ways to hack the system indoors. The company says it’s currently developing an algorithm to address this issue. The activity tracking is based solely on steps, so riding your bike or swimming is not going to earn any coins. Another limitation is that it always needs to be tied to your phone, so if you take a walk and forget your device — or if you’re someone who prefers to jog without lugging along phone — you’re out of luck. Currently, there isn’t a way to sync the app with any smartwatches or fitness trackers, and the company has yet to announce any sort of plan for this type of compatibility. Additionally, the app must always be running on your phone. If you swipe up or force quit, it stops tracking your steps. Thankfully,  it has a battery saver mode which it defaults to when you first download the app, though you do still lose a few steps in the exchange. Among user reviews, there are mixed opinions as to how much battery life it actually uses up. Some say they hardly notice a difference while others have claimed it to be a giant battery drain. Perhaps its biggest limiting factor is that its basic membership limits users to amassing just five coins per day. It does allow for upgrades to the base membership but that does require a payment — in sweatcoins. For example, five SWC per month pushes you to the level of Shaker where you’re allowed to earn 10 sweatcoins per day. The next membership level is Quaker which costs 20 SWC per month and permits 15 SWC a day. Finally, the Breaker membership costs 30SWC per month and allows for up to 20 SWC per day. Sweatcoin also recently announced a Trouble Maker membership it plans on releasing soon, although there aren’t any details available as to what it will cost per month or how many SWCs are allowed to accrue each day. One question a lot of new users ask about Sweatcoin is whether you can trade the currency for cash or PayPal credit — like you . At the moment, this isn’t possible, though there have been rumors since the app launched in 2015 that it’s the company’s ultimate end goal. Despite any formal announcements on the matter, co-founder Oleg Fomenko told  in January that its long-term vision includes plans to develop an “open-source blockchain DLT technology that will allow Sweatcoin to be traded like any other major crypto- or fiat currency.” For now, however, the currency essentially operates like a rewards program similar to those you find with airlines, credit cards, and various mobile apps.",

    "title": "Space Miner One Takes Bitcoin Mining to Space With New ICO Campaign | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " How confident are you in your Bitcoin investment? One company is so bullish on the cryptocurrency market that it sent its bitcoin mining equipment where no mining rig has gone before. In an effort to show its confidence in Bitcoin’s performance in 2018, Miner One sent its rig to space to mine cryptocurrency for a few hours. The mining mission began this morning, April 30, when the Miner One team used a balloon to send a carbon fiber capsule equipped with an  (ASIC), a Raspberry Pi 3, battery, satellite phone, GoPro Hero 5, and a metal souvenir coin for a competition winner, to the height of more than 35,000 meters, or roughly 100,000 feet. A helium-filled balloon was used to lift the Space Minor One capsule to this great height. When the capsule passed through the troposphere — roughly 3.7 to 6.2 miles above earth — the ASIC activated and the satellite phone was used to communicate with the internet. The balloon continued to grow — reaching over 10 meters in diameters at its largest — as it ascended to the stratosphere due to falling air pressure. The mission lasted approximately two hours. At the end of its journey, the balloon exploded, Space Miner One parachuted back to earth, and the capsule landed in a field in Lithuania, where it was retrieved thanks to GPS tracking. Videos of the mission were posted to . “In the middle of what feels like a slump, Miner One wants to remind people that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general is really about the future and the revolutionary technology at its heart: so-called blockchain technology,” the company wrote in a blog post that was published on . Miner One CEO Pranas Slusnys called Bitcoin the world’s most popular and proven application of blockchain technology. Miner One isn’t the only one optimistic about Bitcoin. The company surveyed more than 1,500 community members and found that 31 percent of respondents believed that Bitcoin’s price will exceed $15,000 this year. In fact, only 7.5 percent of those surveyed think that Bitcoin won’t go above $10,000 this year. The mission into space was used to attract publicity for Miner One’s initial coin offering, or ICO, in which it is expected to raise $10 million to build a cryptocurrency mining center. The facility would be located in Northern Sweden  — and not in space, unfortunately — because of the country’s low electricity costs and cool climate, which can offset heat generation. Miner One said that it will share the benefits with the company’s MIO Token Holders. “Short-term ups and downs notwithstanding, these networks will need efficient support centers like the kind Miner One is building,” the company said.",

    "detailContent": " Elio Motors, the Arizona-based startup that boldly promised to change the way America commutes, has received a $2.5 million rescue package from Overstock.com. The investment should help Elio pay its debts and begin building cars after years of costly delays that sapped its credibility, angered the officials who helped it, and threatened to topple the young firm. Overstock purchased $2.5 million in Elio’s common stock. Patrick Byrne, the retailer’s founder and CEO, observed he shares Elio’s vision of bringing an affordable, super-efficient commuter car with three wheels (pictured above) to the American public. “I believe Elio’s vision and business model to build a $7,500 ultra-high mileage, ultra-fuel-efficient car-like vehicle is a win for America,” he said. “I am confident that this will become my car for at least two-thirds of the days I drive,” he added. He recently sat in an early prototype on the streets of Manhattan and concluded it’s a hit in the making. Byrne hinted Overstock could sell Elio’s first car, a move which would help the startup save a substantial amount of money by bypassing the traditional brick-and-mortar dealership model. The company would presumably sell its cars online, though it would still need stores to perform repairs. Of course, Elio needs to build a car before it can start thinking about selling one. The company’s decision-makers confidently stress they can start production in a former General Motors factory located in Shreveport, Louisiana, before the end of next year, according to . Overstock’s investment won’t cover the full cost of launching the three-wheeler, so Elio is turning to cryptocurrency in a bid to raise capital. It will introduce a security token offering (STO) named ElioCoin that it claims is the first digital token associated with production of a motor vehicle. Only institutional accredited investors will be eligible to purchase the initial tokens. The tokens will be traded on an Overstock-owned platform named tZero, and investors will ultimately have the option of redeeming ElioCoins for a car,  explained. Elio has consequently canceled plans to raise money through a $100 million IPO, according to . The news comes as a relief to the roughly 65,000 hand-raisers who sent the company a deposit in exchange for one of the first spots in line. Though Louisiana officials  reservation holders had lost their money, Overstock’s involvement represents a glimmer of hope that Elio will make its intriguing three-wheeler — which promises to return a jaw-dropping 84 mpg without any kind of electrification — a reality.",

    "detailContent": " The past year has seen an explosion of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based businesses, and now one is seeking to  when it comes to the PC and mobile gaming market. Game Loot Network Holdings is attempting to use the  to create an alternative gaming market and player reward system. GLN Holdings is currently holding a pre-sale, but it intends to hold an initial coin offering on May 29. The company’s test run saw $5 million in transactions and had 65,000 users. The company’s hope is that one day its distribution platform, , will be able to serve as an alternative to the likes of Steam and Apple. Many companies have tried to take on Steam in the past. Some, like GOG, have even had success at doing so, but none have ever truly rivaled Steam in size. GLN is hoping that its use of blockchain technology will provide the edge it needs to take on the more established players in the industry. The company believes that its blockchain technology will provide a fast and secure means of handling transactions while its cryptocurrency-based reward system, known as Loot, will incentivize players to return to the platform. It also intends to use the cryptocurrency as a means of giving gamers more options in terms of supporting independent game developers. The company is offering a platform called Build that will allow developers to submit game ideas, story concepts, and demos to players for support and approval. “Prohibitive costs and even greater risks plague the game development landscape,” Lance Baker, GLN’s founder, told Venture Beat. “Big gaming companies want big money, and they leave riskier, innovative games to these independent studios. But the indie guys struggle to compete in a marketplace heavily weighted against them in terms of budget, discoverability, and user acquisition.” In the beginning, GLN’s games will be available on traditional platforms as well, but Baker hopes to move to transition away from them in time. For now, the blockchain has numerous issues holding it back such as the speed of transactions and the instability of the currencies that rely on it. So far, the company has raised $2.5 million from its ICO presale and Baker is optimistic regarding the platform’s future.",

    "title": "Inside a Bitcoin Mine | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Step foot inside a  mine, and the first thing you’ll probably notice is the temperature. Depending on what part of the facility you’re standing in, it’ll either be baking hot or freezing cold. In our case, it was the latter. After descending down a very utilitarian plywood staircase and making our way through a series of locked doors, we emerged in a concrete-floored room where you could see your breath. This was partially because it was winter in Northern Washington state and therefore naturally cold, and partially because there was a giant cooling system blasting frigid air at us from across the room. It was basically like stepping into a sauna. We were in the server room: The part of the building where shelves full of highly specialized computers, known as  (ASICs), work round the clock to mine bitcoin. They do this by solving extremely difficult math problems, and all that work tends to make them get really, really hot. The solution, of course, is to supply them with a steady supply of cold air to prevent them from overheating. The second thing we noticed was the noise. In addition to the large cooling system that blasts chilly air around the warehouse, each individual ASIC unit has its own fan, spinning feverishly and putting off a high pitched whine. Together, they build to a thunderous white noise that you have to yell over to communicate with the person standing next to you. After shouting questions at our tour guide in the rather boring server room (it’s really just a bunch of blinking lights, whirring fans, and jumbled cables) long enough for our fingers to go numb, our guide decided it was time to warm up. We dipped through a heavy door haphazardly fitted into a wall of insulation. It was basically like stepping into a sauna. This part of the facility, our guide explained, was where they vented all of the hot air from the servers and pumped it out of the building. You could feel the heat coming off each ASIC, which felt like a blow-dryer set to high. We conveniently used it to warm up our frozen hands before it was whisked away and blown into the grey winter skies of Wenatchee. Almost all the profits gained from the facility we visited are used to buy new equipment The third thing we noticed was the lack of employees. The whole facility was a ghost town. We were the only people there. Our guide — the guy who owns the place — explained that he employs just two on-call technicians who stop by only whenever something needs to be fixed. Once everything is set up, cryptomines like this one apparently require very little upkeep. Most of the company’s manpower, we’re told, is dedicated to off-site expansion projects on the other side of town, where a handful of other mining facilities are currently under construction. Since the  algorithm typically becomes more difficult as more miners come online, this endless expansion is the name of the game. Almost all the profits gained from the facility we visited are used to buy new equipment that can mine more bitcoin — and do it faster and more efficiently than before. Where does it stop? Nobody knows. But if things keep going at the current pace, the last Bitcoin will be mined around 2,150.",

    "title": "IBM Wants to Apply Blockchain to Jewelry and Authenticate Gems | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " IBM is showing that there is wider usage for blockchain outside of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. With , a blockchain’s decentralized ledger could now be used to track the provenance of jewelry from the mines to retail stores, bringing greater transparency to the jewelry business. This gives jewelers and consumers the ability to see various parts of the supply chain involved in the process. “What we are announcing and bringing forward has been in the works for some time. It’s the first end-to-end industry capability on blockchain that has its core in trust,” IBM general manager of blockchain services Jason Kelley . Various companies in the jewelry supply chain have signed on board with TrustChain so far, including diamond supplier Rio Tinto Diamonds, precious metals refiner Asahi Refining, U.S. retailer Helzberg Diamonds, precious metals supplier LeachGarner, and jewelry manufacturer the Richline Group. Even Underwriters Laboratories is part of the initial consortium to give third-party authentication to the process. Rather than relying on today’s current paper trail in the jewelry manufacturing process, IBM’s TrustChain would allow the entire supply chain to go digital to keep detailed records. Going digital also makes it easier to view and verify each transaction along the process. “If there is a dispute, instead of calling and following back through the process in a more manual way, you can click on a trusted chain, and you’re able to see what happened immediately,” Kelley said. “That reduces the number of steps in the process, and speeds up what has been a paper-laden and manual effort.” This allows data to be shared accurately within the network. This means that only valid and certified members would be allowed into the permissioned blockchain network, and every member on the network must consent to allow each new member to join TrustChain. Given that this is a collaborative effort, if errors are found along the way, IBM hopes that members will correct mistakes quickly along the way. “This is collaboration among responsible and ethical organizations across the jewelry industry, supported by governance and guidance,” the consortium said. “The blockchain collaboration … will track and authenticate diamonds, precious metals, and jewelry at all stages of the global supply chain, from the mine to the retailer.” On the consumer side, IBM hopes that in a year, consumers can use an app on their smartphones to scan a QR code on the jewelry at retail stores to see every step in the supply chain.",

    "detailContent": " Thousands of investors who poured money and time into the John McAfee-evangelized cryptocurrency ecommerce project, Bezop, have become the victims of data theft. The startup reportedly left the personal details of more than 25,000 investors on a publicly accessible MongoDB database, including links to scanned passports, drivers licenses, and other forms of photo ID. Bezop is a cryptocurrency startup that is reportedly designed to act as a distributed online retail platform for third-party sellers. As the paid-for-sponsor, McAfee described it, “it allows simple and secure creation of ecommerce sites — searchable in the same manner as Amazon — but with no Amazon as middleman.” As “secure” as the eventual platform may be though, Bezop doesn’t appear to have done a tremendous job of securing its early investors’ information. The public database was accessible as recently as March 30, according to  and revealed just about everything about investors — including scanned document images. The thousands of individuals affected by this leak are said to be early investors and promoters, the latter of whom were paid in Bezop’s tokens to promote the cryptocurrency on forums and social media.

    "title": "Who’s to blame for the GPU pricing crisis? AMD, Nvidia, retailers – and more | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Graphics cards have been impossibly expensive for over a year now. It’s a problem that could drive gamers to consoles, stifle the do-it-yourself PC industry, and hamper start-ups hoping to use GPUs for research. The GPU drought may not be a passing fad, either. High pricing has left everyone pointing fingers, from gamers, to retailers, to the manufacturers themselves. It’d be comforting to think that a single greedy business might be blamed for the problem, but the reality is more complex, and worrisome for anyone who hopes to buy a reasonably priced video card. Let’s get right to the facts. Most graphics cards sold today are selling for above the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, and that’s been true for the past year. We  back in mid-2017 when we noted prices for graphics cards had begun to skyrocket. It was  which had only just launched in April. An RX 580 which debuted at $230 could cost you as much as $700 at some retailers. Similar problems were faced by those looking to buy RX 570, and even RX 560 cards. Nvidia wasn’t immune, either. While its high-end cards were only seeing small price rises, the GTX 1060 and 1070 were often at least 50 percent more expensive than they should be. Somehow, those problems became even worse in the months that followed. Alongside mid-range card pricing explosions, entry-level and high-end cards also ramped up in price. , A GTX 1060 which launched at $200 could cost as much as $800. The GTX 1080 Ti, which debuted at $700, could sell for more than $1,200. There is a stark difference in the makeup of this generation’s Nvidia card purchases. AMD’s new flagship cards, the Vega 56 and 64 — which debuted in August four months prior — jumped from launch prices of $400-500, to more than $1,000 at most retailers. That’s if they were available at all which, usually, they weren’t. As of  at the end of the tunnel – but prices are still far higher than they should be. As a  approaches on the horizon, gamers are concerned we’ll see a new generation of cards that are once again out of stock, and overpriced. While the GPU pricing crisis has been ongoing for over a year now, responses from the two companies at the heart of the issue, AMD and Nvidia, have been vague when they’re available at all. Both promise gamers remain important to them and have stated an intent to improve supply, but the details of their efforts are scarce. They’ve allowed global stocks to deplete to the point that this pricing problem was created in the first place, and they’ve certainly benefited from the pricing crisis. Both companies posted strong earnings in the latest quarterly reports, and overall discrete desktop graphics shipments were up near 10 percent year on year. AMD even appears to have  over the past year, despite the shortages. Unfortunately, both AMD and Nvidia refused to speak to Digital Trends for this article. Both companies sent us a statement saying they were entering a typical “quiet” period and wouldn’t be commenting on the topic of  finances. That leaves us to speculate about their part to play in the GPU pricing crisis. While it’s debatable whether they could have done more to combat this crisis when it first began, the actions of each company suggest their priorities have shifted away from gamers. According to the people we’ve spoken to, those buying expensive cards in larger quantities are of more interest to both companies than the typical DIY PC builders and retail gamers. Even companies that buy stock for sale to individual consumers are finding acquisition difficult. The head of purchasing at , Andrew Gibson, told us that his company has found it increasingly difficult to get hold of graphics cards at competitive prices throughout the past year, from both manufacturers and distributors. His solution was to offer aggressive discounts to members of the site’s forum to make sure GPUs ended up in the hands of gamers. That, however, was done on his own initiative.   “What I am doing is purely and solely done by OCUK,” he said. “We’ve had no outside assistance from Nvidia, AMD, or board partners, to try and reduce prices for gamers, so we do it ourselves by buying extremely aggressive, reducing our margins etc.” Companies that focus on selling pre-built systems don’t appear to have had quite as much of an issue. Falcon Northwest, a system builder based in Medford, Oregon, voiced more support for the manufacturers. “We’ve had no outside assistance from Nvidia, AMD, or board partners to try and reduce prices from gamers.” “We’ve got a decades long history selling Nvidia, and it’s been good to work with through the madness of the mining craze,” Falcon NW founder and president, Kelt Reeves told Digital Trends.  “[Nvidia has] people dedicated to supporting system building companies like us.  We provide it with sales forecasts for the quantities we think we’ll need for our system builds, and it’s done its best to allocate the GPUs we’ll need through the board partners and distribution.” Large retailers have faced the same supply problems as everyone else, but they hold a different position from most. Often, they’re the storefronts that allow listing video cards at inflated prices. Amazon and Newegg don’t increase prices themselves, but they do make money off third-party sellers who use their websites to scale video cards. One source in the PC hardware industry, who wished to remain anonymous, told Digital Trends of severe scalping in the early days of the graphics card price hikes. Specifically citing Newegg, they told us of situations where 50 or more graphics cards would be purchased from Newegg and then immediately listed at an inflated price on the same site, thereby receiving Newegg promotion, and the benefits of an official-looking listing. “It’s like concert tickets,” our source commented, “Except imagine Ticketmaster owned Stubhub, and Stubhub was just a reseller on Ticketmaster’s own website.” Newegg did not reply to Digital Trends’ request for comment. Newegg has recently implemented purchase limits on video cards to curtail this practice. Amazon, meanwhile, is arguably more transparent when identifying third party sellers, which makes the difference between first-party listings and vendor listings more obvious. However, Amazon has no sales limit for video cards, so nothing stops scalpers buying everything they can find. While Nvidia and AMD said they were putting gamers first, they don’t seem to have qualms about other industries buying up large stocks of cards. While certain retailer purchase limits might stall individuals gaming the system, that doesn’t stop companies who buy directly from the manufacturers or add-in-board partners. Indeed, it may even be that AMD, Nvidia, and their partners have been giving preferential treatment to cryptocurrency mining hardware companies due to their volume purchases. During our chat with  earlier this year, Digital Trends was told the company had little difficulty buying large quantities of cards. “Commercially we’re at a different scale,” explained founder, Josh Riddett, who told us that his company alone buys several hundred graphics cards a month. No wholesaler, retailer or manufacturer had shown any interest in limiting his number of purchases either. Although prices have gone up for him too, he said he frequently sees favorable rates for buying in bulk. Edgar Bers, the head of business development and communications at cloud mining company  his firm buys hundreds of AMD 400, 500 and Nvidia GTX 1060 cards a month. While it sources its cards from Estonian retailers, he did say that his company regularly secured discounts for the bulk purchases, and never had any problems with supply – even if the prices had gone up in recent months. Despite this, AMD and Nvidia claim that cryptocurrency miners have made little difference to their bottom line.  reiterating numbers released during its Q4 2017 earnings call, that “annual revenue related to Blockchain was approximately mid-single digit percent in 2017.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent  that cryptocurrency mining attributed to a small percentage of Nvidia’s overall business. Another pressure on Nvidia’s graphics card business is machine learning. If you watched CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the GDC earlier this year, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Nvidia was an AI hardware developer. Its t made it sound like one, too. The first  it debuted for its new Volta generation was the Titan V, a multi-thousand dollar card that was designed to , far more than it is to push additional pixels through to your new  display. AMD is also working on AI hardware, with an ongoing partnership with  in its self-driving cars and the hint of a new,  on the horizon. Gamers and hardware enthusiasts are no longer the only market for graphics cards. With this pivot by both companies towards AI development, gamers are once again sharing the global stock of graphics cards with a burgeoning industry. A , appeared online in late 2017, which claimed that it had been buying up masses of GPUs for AI research. It claimed that that was the main reason for shortages in Russia, and associated price hikes. That kind of purchasing may be replicated in western markets.  in September 2017 which suggested a sizeable portion of Nvidia’s “gaming” sales were down to machine-learning and data-center companies buying gaming graphics cards for their own AI development purposes. It suggested that gaming graphics cards were far cheaper, and often performed better, than existing server-grade chips. The report cited AI start-up Clarifai as a major proponent of using Titan , often overclocked to achieve higher levels of performance, for its goals. Clarifai’s CEO, Matt Zeiler, even suggested that Nvidia has entirely new targets in mind when it comes to its hardware in the near future. “If you look back a few years ago, Nvidia was just a gaming company,” Zeiler told Forbes. “They’ve completely shifted to machine learning.” That’s certainly been the case over the last year. The combination of AI and cryptocurrency purchases providing a rapidly increasing demand, and rabid retailers (both first and third-party) only too happy to capitalize on the trend, drove prices to unprecedented levels. While prices have subsided some in recent months, these trends give reason to fear they won’t return to normalcy soon. If even large retailers dedicated to these audiences have struggled to get the stock they need, it seems likely that problems will continue for gamers in the future – especially as automotive adoption of AI looks set to explode in the next few years. While supply may one day catch up with demand, and pricing may return to some semblance of normality, gamers will need to wait for that day to come. Even if it does happen, one thing’s for certain —  gamers are no longer the only child of graphics card companies. They are going to have to learn to share.",

    "detailContent": " One of the biggest concerns of blockchain developers, is what happens when quantum computers become a viable alternative to modern computers? In theory, their computing power could invalidate the encryption that secures blockchains from tampering. One intriguing solution suggests leveraging quantum mechanics to protect the blockchain from quantum computers. Blockchain technology is far from easy to get your head around. We have an , but in a nutshell, it’s a digital ledger which uses encryption to validate new entries and protect old ones. It’s most common use is as the backbone of , but it’s also found use  and . One of its  in the future though, is that the sheer power of a quantum computer could easily break the blockchain’s encryption safeguards, giving the computer’s owner control over a blockchain’s past and future. While quantum computers aren’t yet viable in such a scenario, they will be in the future, which is why researchers like Del Rajan have been devising potential solutions.  co-authored with Matt Visser, a fellow physicist at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, the pair propose a blockchain that leverages quantum entanglement — the practice of linking two or more particles together. When entangled, each particle can influence the other simultaneously, no matter the distance between them. Where traditional entanglement bridges vast distances to send information though, Rajan and Visser’s paper suggests entangling across time instead. They propose encoding the blockchain into quantum entangled photons, the most recent of which is summarily absorbed by the next one in the blockchain. In theory, this should make it possible to validate transactions, while preventing alterations to the blockchain, since the original entangled photon does not exist anymore. Although the possibility would still exist for a hacker with massive quantum computing power to manipulate the latest photon (block), that would only invalidate that one block, making it obvious that a hack too place. Crucially though, they wouldn’t be able to tamper with the rest of the blockchain. All of this exists in theory at the moment, though the two paper’s authors note that each component of the idea has been realized in experimental scenarios. Perhaps the most intriguing claim of the whole paper though, is that such a system could be viewed in some measure as a “quantum networked time machine,” as .",

    "title": "Paxful\u0027s Formerly Homeless Founder Wants to Give Back With Bitcoin | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Much of the wealth created by cryptocurrency has been siphoned off by established tech entrepreneurs. The  and  of the world, who saw the upswing coming and had money to invest in it, have gained the most. Ray Youssef, the co-founder of Bitcoin direct-trade platform, Paxful, is a little different. While he still exudes the self-driven, cavalier attitude of many tech entrepreneurs, he sees himself as Robin Hood, not a slick Silicon Valley yuppie. Maybe that’s because he has eaten out of dumpsters and slept on park benches.  Before he founded one of the biggest cryptocurrency peer to peer exchanges in the world, Youssef was driven to homelessness by cryptocurrency. Today, Youssef is a self-made Bitcoin success story. Yet he claims that Paxful was never about making money. To him, it’s all about helping the little guy and giving back from his success, specifically in the developing world. He’s a man who isn’t afraid to disregard the rules if he sees them as unjust. And his story is a microcosm of the broader conflict between success and responsibility that plagues Silicon Valley. Born Ryam Azab Youssef, the eventual Paxful founder began launching startups and unconventional ventures in the early ’00s. He headed up a successful polyphonic ringtone business called MatrixM, then founded a less successful social network and dating platform called FunHi. He also joined a movement to bring back Victorian era technology inspired by Nikolai Tesla, had a stint as an actor, became , and changed his name first to Ray Savant, then to Mohammed Youssef, along the way. He now goes by Ray Youssef. “A lot of people may be ashamed of [being homeless] digging through trash, but I’m not.” Clearly, Youssef’s not afraid to dive head first into new ideas and push them forward with his own brand of tenacity and personal belief. His attention turned towards cryptocurrency in 2012, when he posted his motorcycle for sale on an internet forum. One poster suggested he take payment in Bitcoin. “I thought ‘Bitcoin […] that’s nerd money,” Youssef told Digital Trends with a chuckle. “But I kept looking into it over a few months, and I really started to fall in love with the whole thing. The technology was amazing, but it was the passion of the community that really caught my eye.” That infatuation with the community’s drive is what lead Youssef to launch EasyBitz two years later with Artur Schaback, a friend he met at a Bitcoin conference. The two would later go on to found Paxful, but EasyBitz was their first joint project. It served as a payment provider for small businesses, street vendors, and independent artists, and was designed to make it easy for them to accept Bitcoin payments from customers. The company immediately ran into a small problem, however. No one wanted to use it. “At the time, nobody really had any Bitcoin [to spend],” he admitted. “As easy as we tried to make it, it was still too complex to use, and New York retailers were really not into that kind of thing.” Not perturbed by these early difficulties, Youssef pushed forward even harder, using the aggressive strategy of giving Bitcoin away in pre-made wallets. Even that didn’t work. “I remember being in Washington Square Park, going to the musicians there, saying “Hey, you should accept Bitcoin donations,” and I gave them this card with a barcode on it with instructions on how they could [accept it],” he said. “It even came with $100 worth of Bitcoin, which now would be worth about $5,000 or something like that. They refused it! No one would take it!” Both Youssef and Schaback pushed EasyBitz for a full year, and soon found themselves up against a brick wall. Money became scarce. Eventually, the pair couldn’t make rent. “There were days at a time where I just decided to ‘stay outside’ and would crash in the park.” “Artur crashed with my best friend George, and then a month later I had to leave my place because my mother needed help, so I rented it out,” Youssef explained. “For three months I was homeless and going from crash pad to crash pad, usually with girls from my past, and couch surfing. There were days at a time where I just decided to ‘stay outside’ and would crash in the park.” The resourcefulness that kept him moving from startup to startup kept him well fed during that time in his life, despite his poverty. “I quickly figured out that being homeless in NYC meant you didn’t ever have to go hungry at night,” he said. “I ate very well once I figured out where the best restaurants threw their trash. Huge chunks of sashimi could be found in Tribeca. In Sutton Place, I discovered a never-ending supply of pizza dough at the Domino’s Pizza, and two Greek places in Murray Hill became weekly favorites, with feta cheese salad and some amazing fish leftovers.” Although at the lowest point in his life financially, Youssef says he turned down any financial donations while on the street. He had daytime work at cafes and continued to work on EasyBitz when possible. Then his business partner, Schabeck, ran into a friend with an idea that would quickly put him back on his feet. 2015 was still two years before Bitcoin , but interest was growing. Many people were willing to pay a premium to own Bitcoin. “A friend of ours, Max, came to us and said ‘hey, you guys can actually sell $250 worth of Bitcoin and get a $500 Paypal MyCash gift card in exchange and just spend the profit with your Paypal Visa card,’” Youssef said. “We looked at him and thought, why would anyone do that?” You would be forgiven for assuming that anyone willing to pay twice something’s value using a digital service could be leveraging a stolen credit card or hacked account to do so, but Youssef insists that was not the case. There was risk involved, he explains. People were willing to effectively pay double the going rate for a Bitcoin purchase through Paypal because using a payment processor was notoriously dangerous for cryptocurrency sellers. Paypal’s chargeback system allowed Bitcoin buyers to effectively scam the seller by sending a payment, receiving the Bitcoin they bought, and then claiming they were scammed, prompting Paypal to return the funds used to purchase it. Due to Bitcoins’ decentralized nature, there’s no remediation process, leaving sellers out of pocket. Youssef quickly began to turn a healthy profit by selling Bitcoin to Paypal purchasers, and soon he and Schabeck had turned their fortunes around. They even roped their friends in to effectively set up a business facilitating Paypal purchases of the cryptocurrency. There were limits to what the business could accomplish at that scale, however. Selling Bitcoin through BitcoinTalk and LocalBitcoins gave them a good start, but the sites weren’t designed for volume trades, which made the process of buying and selling complicated. Youssef saw the potential to launch his own cryptocurrency trading platform. That became Paxful. Paxful differed from its competitors by focusing on gift cards. They had been Youssef’s salvation, and much like cryptocurrencies themselves, they can operate outside the existing structure of financial institutions. This makes them extremely valuable to people who don’t have a bank account for depositing or sending money – the “unbanked,” as finance wonks call them. Three months into Paxful’s operation, he received a call from someone in dire straits. “Artur and I were working in Soho, 2 a.m. or so, it was really late,” Youssef said. “We had put our number on the website and no one ever called. But all of a sudden, I got a call and it was this woman. She said ‘I need some Bitcoin. I need it, I’m down to my last $13.’ She was frantic, telling me how her kids were going to be homeless the next day if she doesn’t get this Bitcoin.” This might seem like hyperbole – indeed, the fanaticism over people’s desire to  at its 2017 peak was certainly overblown – but it turned out that the woman had a very real reason, a real need, to buy some Bitcoin. “She was frantic, telling me how her kids were going to be homeless the next day if she doesn’t get this Bitcoin.” “She needed it to post an advert on Backpage,” Youssef explained — a site notorious for facilitating prostitution. The classified site’s shady reputation  for it, but the site still accepted Bitcoin. The problem, however, was that getting hold of Bitcoin wasn’t easy, particularly if you didn’t have a bank account. “I had to walk her through it. She was so angry, she’d spent eight hours going around the internet every Bitcoin site trying to get one and she couldn’t do it because all of the Bitcoin sites you had to have a bank account,” Youssef told Digital Trends. “This was a completely unbanked person in the United States. So, I asked her, how were you buying these ads before? She said she bought gift cards in the drug store.” “For the next three months, every single day we would get [calls], mostly women, who were looking for [Bitcoin],” Youssef said. “They were all in a desperate situation, but the beauty of that entire episode is that it helped us get our product market fit. If someone has a bank account they can , but if you don’t have a bank account or are underbanked, Paxful is the place you go to.” Youssef remains unapologetically proud of Paxful’s start, despite the hot water Backpage eventually ended up in.  came under fire in 2017 for its anything-goes attitude, and the posting of classified adverts for sex work ultimately resulted in the site’s seizure by . Seven people associated with Backpage, including its founders, have been indicted on charges that include money laundering and facilitating prostitution. “…the free market will win in the end, and we do believe there are many lawmakers looking for a better way.” , better known as the “Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,” allows authorities to hold sites liable for misuse of their classifieds, and forced Craigslist to  when it passed Congress earlier this year. Youssef said he supports the new law’s ideas, but worried it could do more damage than good. “Sex trafficking is indeed a problem that should be handled with all the resources of the state,” he stated, “yet the ramifications of this bill have clearly thrown an entire community into disarray, putting single mothers in serious jeopardy […]” As Youssef sees it, the best thing anyone can do, whether business owner, government or individual, is to try and improve the day to day lives of everyday people. He remains adamant that Paxful has accomplished that, and seems confident that, even after the passage of H.R. 1865, lawmakers will ultimately reconsider. “This isn’t the kind of day-to-day difference we wanted to see,” Youssef told Digital Trends, “but the free market will win in the end, and we do believe there are many lawmakers looking for a better way.” Today, Paxful is a direct trade platform with a claimed user base of 1.5 million customers. It trades thousands of Bitcoin a month, moving millions of dollars through the site on a regular basis. Many of those users do so from all over the world, and it’s those international markets that have Youssef so excited. He sees those markets as in even greater need of the financial fluidity that cryptocurrencies offer. Often, transactions still rely on the gift cards that kickstarted this whole venture. “iTunes is a very special case,” Youssef said. “It’s how most of Nigeria and Africa get their Bitcoins. Right now on Paxful, $11 million of iTunes gift cards go from Nigeria to China every week.” While this remains a convoluted way to exchange cash, Youssef thinks it’s a better solution than financial institutions for those in vulnerable situations. “In Nigeria, for example […] these folks prefer to keep their money in crypto,” Youssef explained. “So even in the fall of cryptocurrencies [in December 2017] some of them who bought it at the beginning of the year are still up [several hundred percent]. In Nigeria, […] their local currency has fallen by 90 percent in the past two years [so] their neighbours would be down 40 percent for the year.” Youssef explained that where Western markets often see Bitcoin as purely a store of value, as a way of investing and growing wealth, elsewhere in the world it’s more commonly used as a means of payment. Independent businesses in Africa are some of its biggest proponents, leveraging Paxful and Bitcoin to improve their fortunes, much as Youssef himself had. “[When] I went to Nigeria I met this very charming, beautiful woman, who was making amazing women’s clothing and she had an Instagram site,” he said. “She didn’t have a shopping cart. [Customers] sent the money to her friend in America who also has a Nigerian bank account and he transferred the money to her.” “Right now on Paxful, $11 million of iTunes gift cards go from Nigeria to China every week.” Youssef ultimately set her up on Paxful, so she could accept Bitcoin for clothes and then sell the Bitcoin herself. “We made that whole process peer to peer, so that anyone could help her do this without needing trust because of escrow,” he said. Youssef’s also hopes to focus his company on philanthropic endeavours. Although he’s excited about the potential for Paxful to accept more cryptocurrencies in the future, he spends a lot of time working with charities. He wants to help them accept Bitcoin donations to give easier access to the money in a local currency through Paxful trading. “We’re calling the initiative #BuiltWithBitcoin,” he said. “We’ve built one school so far, with three more planned in Africa. We’re just getting plans for one in Venezuela, one in Nigeria that is planned too.” The scheme was launched with a $50,000 donation by Paxful to , a volunteer-driven charitable organization that builds wells and schools in middle-Eastern and African countries like Afghanistan and Rwanda. It’s one of the charities that Youssef has focused on. It takes Bitcoin and Ethereum donations already, and Youssef wants more charities to get on board with the idea. “I encourage people to get behind #BuiltWithBitcoin,” he said. “Because once you educate these charities about Bitcoin they are in awe, because they can get the funds immediately, cash out to their bank account anywhere in the world, immediately, using a service like Paxful. It’s never been so easy to give back.” Bitcoin dragged Youssef to his lowest financial depths, and boosted him back to financial freedom, giving him a first-hand taste of its capacity for good and evil. He doesn’t shy away from that moral ambiguity in his business, which can be used to stabilize the life savings for farmers in Rwanda or simply used to . Despite the extremes, Youssef is guided by an underlying optimism about humanity. He doesn’t ask how his business might be used for ill, but instead tries to use it for good. Some might call it honorable. Others might call it naïve. But like Bitcoin itself, Paxful seems destined to become whatever society makes of it.",

Wikileaks can still accept payments via Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it will have to find a new way to convert those tokens into hard currencies.

We have come full circle. Many people’s interest in Bitcoin started when Wikileaks was out under an extra judicial embargo by VISA, MC, PayPal and banks. Now Coinbase has repeated history. Oops.  — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop)  One of the big appeals of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they are largely unregulated and anonymous. This makes them ideal for those who for reasons legitimate and otherwise,  are concerned about privacy. However, in recent months, we have seen an increasing amount of regulatory oversight. Part of this is due to the simple fact that governments are finally starting to catch up to cryptocurrencies. The SEC has recently started to  operating as initial coin offerings. The IRS has also started taxing cryptocurrency as it does with other investments though the enforcement on that is still a bit murky. As for Wikileaks, there are other cryptocurrency exchanges it could use.

The SEC also alleges that Trapani and the others knowingly engaged in fraud and point to a string of text messages as evidence of its claims. “Text messages among the defendants reveal their fraudulent intent,” the complaint reads. “After receiving a cease-and-desist letter from a major bank directing him to remove any reference to the bank from Centra’s marketing materials, Sharma texted to Farkas and Trapani: ‘[w]e gotta get that s[***] removed everywhere and blame freelancers lol.’”  And, while trying to get the CTR Tokens listed on an exchange using phony credentials, Trapani texted Sharma to “cook me up” a false document, prompting Sharma to reply, “Don’t text me that s[***] lol.  Delete.” In addition to the SEC’s complaints, Tech Crunch reports that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has  against Trapani. “As alleged, Raymond Trapani conspired with his co-defendants to lure investors with false claims about their product and about relationships they had with credible financial institutions,” said Deputy U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami. “While investing in virtual currencies is legal, lying to deceive investors is not.” In addition to the alleged deception, Centra’s ICO was bolstered by endorsements from celebrities such as recently retired boxer superstar Floyd Mayweather.

    "title": "Amazon Patent Suggests it Wants to Rat Out Bitcoin Owners | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Amazon has a brand-new patent to its name that takes a distinctly authoritative stance against the decentralized, pseudo-anonymous nature of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. It details methods with which the global retail giant could leverage its data stores to identify the participants in Bitcoin transactions in order to sell that information on to a subscriber base, a major component of which would be law enforcement. For many people, the best feature of Bitcoin and its altcoins is that they allow for some measure of anonymity in their use. That’s why, alongside many legitimate trading purposes, Bitcoin has been used as the  and . But even so, it’s . The blockchain itself is open and viewable by anyone and Amazon believes it can leverage enough data to help identify those behind the transactions it is used for. The patent, originally filed in 2014 and only just recently awarded, describes a comprehensive data approach that sees Amazon working together with other retailers and telecom companies to link Bitcoin transactions with shipping addresses and IP addresses, as per . That “data stream” could then be leveraged by government authorities for tax or law enforcement purposes,  suggests. In one cited example, the patent states that law enforcement agencies may be interested in ‘subscribing’ to the “data stream” of information, allowing them to access lists of “global Bitcoin transactions, correlated by country, with ISP data to determine source IP addresses and shipping addresses.” It’s not likely to be wrong either, as the NSA has reportedly been attempting to develop a method of identifying Bitcoin users since 2013, as per . Although this patent may raise concerns from those hoping to remain anonymous in their Bitcoin dealings, it is important to highlight that IP addresses have proven to be  in the past. Using a , or a Tor connection, while making Bitcoin transactions, would immediately make Amazon’s described system redundant. With that in mind, it may be that the Amazon patent is less interested in identifying criminals and more targeted at highlighting potential tax implications of utilizing Bitcoin to make legitimate purchases on legitimate websites. The online retail giant has yet to make any kind of public statement on the matter, so it could also be that this patent was more to shore up a potential idea or stop others from doing something similar. One intriguing element of the patent filing however, is that it cites , related to cryptographic tokens. That was filed a full four years before the public launch of Bitcoin.",

    "detailContent": " In a twist of irony,  — which worked on Donald Trump’s digital campaign strategy and was the subject of scandal for Facebook — had been quietly working on its own virtual currency designed for an initial coin offering, or ICO. Cambridge Analytica’s cryptocurrency was conceived as a means to pay for a system allowing people to store and sell their online data to advertisers, former employee  told  in an interview, essentially allowing people to protect the data that the company had exploited from some . Cambridge Analytica promoted its virtual currency business to blockchain companies wishing to use predictive modeling to target investors. The psychographic profiles that the company has created allow for more precisely targeted advertising. “Who knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica?” Kaiser said in an her interview. “So why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that works?” Work for the virtual currency began in the middle of last year, with Cambridge Analytica aiming to raise as much as $30 million through the ICO, according to . “Prior to the  controversy, we were developing a suite of technologies to help individuals reclaim their personal data from corporate entities and to have full transparency and control over how their personal data are used,” a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said in an email statement to Reuters. “We were exploring multiple options for people to manage and monetize their personal data, including blockchain technology.” Jill Carlson, a consultant for several blockchain companies who had attended pitch meetings with Cambridge Analytica, said that the company’s approach “was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like Bitcoin,” according to the Times report. “The way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way,” Carlson said. In one instance, Cambridge Analytica would send virtual currency to different areas in Mexico as incentive for people to fill out surveys. The data would be used to design political campaigns for Mexican candidates running for office. Work on the the coin’s technical specification was overseen by Alexander Taylor, Cambridge Analytica’s chief data scientist. Kaiser has since left the company, in January, and remains critical of Cambridge Analytica. It’s unclear if Cambridge Analytica is still pursuing work on the coin, though Kaiser believes that the work has not moved forward. “A spokesman did not comment on the coin offering, but did say the firm was looking at using blockchain — the technology underlying digital currencies — to help people secure their online data,” Reuters reported. Kaiser is pursuing similar ideas in her new role at Bueno Capital.",

After Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently lamented his, perhaps,  (or, as we call them: robots) to build his cars,  Obviously, the production pause is just that – a pause – and Musk says that once the production system gets out of “production hell” as he calls it, the Fremont plant should be able to make their goal of snapping together 5,000 of the cars a week. That’s 29 cars an hour, if the plant runs 24/7, or one Model 3   – which is a whole lot more than the zero per hour currently being produced. And while Musk has a terrible record of meeting deadlines and production goals, he also has a pretty good track record at making amazing stuff, from those five-star electric cars to solar-power roofs to rockets that come back for a perfect landing. Is the Tesla Model 3 going to be worth the, likely long wait for the  people that have pre-ordered it?

Blockchain technology, in a nutshell, is a not-so-complicated internet-based bookkeeping scheme that uses data encryption, so it can be securely used to protect data about pretty much anything, not just securing bitcoins and other crypto currencies. The encryption system is so tough, it can be used across an almost unlimited number of applications, from medical records to DMV records, to voting booths, to gaming to supply lines for manufacturing.

    "detailContent": " Pornhub visitors wanting to keep their monthly subscription off the credit card bill now have an alternative form of payment — . More specifically, the biggest porn stash on the internet now accepts  payments for , including the Pornhub Premium subscription service. The move to cryptocurrency is the site’s solution for the need to remain innovative while protecting privacy. “Not only is this an exciting announcement for us and the adult entertainment industry, it’s exciting for the crypto space,” . “History has proven that the adult entertainment industry plays a critical role in adoption for innovative technology. We saw that with VHS, Beta Max, credit card payment icons and, most recently, VR goggles. We expect to see widespread adoption of crypto and blockchain in short order.” First launched in 2014 as DogecoinDark, Verge Currency aims to bring private payments to businesses and individuals. It’s an open-source platform supported by community members versus other cryptocurrencies funded by private companies and initial coin offerings. Verge relies on a TOR-based component that hides your IP address while a second I2P component sends data through an encrypted “tunnel” across the network. What is interesting about this specific cryptocurrency is the Wraith Protocol — a technology that enables users to switch between public and private ledgers on the Verge blockchain. With this feature turned on, the blockchain explorer doesn’t see your transaction, thus it’s not linked to your public address. But if the feature is switched off, the blockchain explorer will see your transactions linked to your public address. “Verge integrates Tor in its Core, Electrum, and  wallets, thereby eliminating any single point at which the communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination,” . Along with the main Pornhub site, both Brazzers (adult HD videos) and Nutaku (adult gaming) will start accepting Verge Currency as well.  The news follows the site’s move to secure HTTPS connections . The site said the switch was due to an ongoing effort to increase confidentiality and privacy for visitors. It was also in response to the repeal of internet privacy rules that previously prevented internet service providers from selling browsing histories. After that,  for the visually impaired, such as providing enlarged text, adding keyboard shortcuts, providing customized color contrasts, text descriptions, and more. The company even launched an  combining virtual experiences with adult-oriented fun. These toys not only link to specific videos on Pornhub but also synchronize with each other across the internet. Clearly, Pornhub is trying to stay ahead of the competition.  “Here at Pornhub, we have always strongly valued innovation and privacy,” Price said. “Our acceptance of Verge is an affirmation of our dedication to innovation and privacy. [We] think Verge, with its focus on anonymity, is the best option whether for privacy, convenience or both.”",

    "title": "Blockchain Board Gaming With The Android-Powered PlayTable | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Digital and physical board games both have their advantages. Where one has easy set up and clean up, the other has a physicality that’s impossible to replicate on a screen. Combing the best – and ditching the worst – of each has long been a dream for gamers and toymakers. Now, PlayTable wants to make that dream a reality. It’s an Android-powered, tabletop gaming tablet that leverages blockchain technology and RFID tags, to put real world toys into digital worlds in a manner that goes well beyond Nintendo’s Amiibo and Disney Infinity. Developed by  PlayTable features a 24-inch 1080p display with multi-touch capabilities and no internal battery. As a touch-screen gaming device it is underpowered compared to the  and 2-in-1s out there, but where it stands apart is in its close ties with the Ethereum blockchain, which cribs the concept of toy-based interaction from the likes of  or , and makes the next logical leap. “Where toys to life 1.0, as I like to call them, went wrong, is that […] these toys, really became just that: toys,” Jimmy Chen, CEO of Blok.Party told Digital Trends. “They weren’t actually figures that you end up playing with. What we’re doing is actually taking these figures and allowing you to play with them – that’s a critical part of the experience.” As well as using figures to store character progression and customization, like  and  figures do, toys placed on a PlayTable act as the pieces in the game you’re playing. In the case of the tactical card battler , which we were shown in a demo, a dragon toy was placed on the screen and physically moved on its turn. The PlayTable tracked its movement, highlighting potential move locations on the digital battlefield and displaying effects for attacks, which were triggered by placing RFID-tag-equipped cards on the screen itself. Where this ‘toys to life 2.0’ system really shines is through its link with the Ethereum blockchain. Every single toy’s  will have its own entry, so the data can be read and interpreted by the PlayTable instantaneously, anywhere in the world with an internet connection, without relying on a single, centralized server. The real strength of the blockchain is that it doesn’t constrain the toys to one digital or physical medium. “Figures don’t just exist within the confines of one game, they can be used in multiple games, on multiple devices, and even have multiple owners,” Chen explained. This is at the core of the PlayTable experience. Children will be able to take their favorite toy, put an RFID tag on it, and then use it as a character in the digital board games they play. They can do that on their own PlayTable, or at a friends’ house. Adult gamers can trade toys, changing ownership either by physically handing over the toy, or digitally over the blockchain. “Figures don’t just exist within the confines of one game, they can be used in multiple games, on multiple devices, and even have multiple owners.” This also makes it easier for companies that sell games, or “structured experiences,” as Chen puts it, to maintain some measure of control over their content. “The moment you put a tracker on a figure, it can now forever be tied to the original owner, which factory it came from. We know it’s owned by a particular IP owner and they can open and close different “switches” that allow for these different intentions for those who own the physical piece,” Chen explained. “This ownership is interesting because now when we think of software in general, it’s always this thing where people are coming in and [effectively] renting software from the IP owner. With blockchain there’s almost a dual ownership system. It’s ownership, it’s customization, with unique possibilities that you can’t otherwise have.” Early partners include classic board games like  and , but the potential is there for many hundreds of other smaller board games to work well on such a platform. If the digital components can fit on the screen, then the game can be played. Chen and Blok.Party don’t want to stop at digital games, however. They want to explore the creativity of such a platform. They want to see universes collide as gamers create their own experiences and shared game worlds. “When [children] play in the real world, they don’t care that Elsa and Darth Vader come from two different worlds,” Chen explained. “To them they all exist in the same physical world. This kind of play pattern is what we want to encourage with PlayTable. You can 3D print your own characters – maybe it’s a 3D printed version of yourself in costume – take the existing characters in your toybox, and do interesting things with them […] You can battle with your characters with different stats and different abilities.” Still, PlayTable could be facing uphill battle convincing the public to pay for yet another gaming system which, at $350 for the pre-ordered base version with just 16GB of storage, is more expensive than the exceedingly popular Nintendo Switch. That could be an even harder sell at its intended $600 launch price, especially considering how  so many other  at much lower prices. “The PlayTable could be facing uphill battle convincing the public to pay for yet another gaming system.” Blok.Party is hoping that the PlayTable’s extensive feature set will help set it apart from more typical consoles, though. It’s splash proof, and uses strengthened glass to make it resistant to torture from young children – a big advantage over many other gaming systems with touch-screens. It supports 1-8 players locally, and as many as you want over online multiplayer with other PlayTables. The PlayTable will live or die on its support from gamers and game makers. With a custom,  operating system known as PlayTable OS, the ease with which existing digital games can be ported to it could be a major factor in how expansive the game library becomes. If your group’s favorite game is playable, that’s going to be quite attractive to frequent board gamers. However, if the process of bringing games to it is complicated or slow, we could be faced with the chicken and egg problem that has plagued new gaming platforms throughout the industry’s history. PlayTable has a lot to prove when it launches later this year.",

    "title": "What Are Smart Contracts? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " One of the most important elements of any transaction, be it a trade for goods or services, is trust. Both parties need to trust that the other will fulfil their end of the bargain. One classic method of ensuring that has been contracts — but legal documents require expertise and oversight to enforce them. Smart contracts have the potential to change all that. What are smart contracts? In many ways, they’re no different from a contract you might have signed to complete a job, or buy a house. Unlike those, however, they’re digital and automated. Smart contracts write the agreement of the contract directly into lines of code, doing away with the need for a central organization to approve that either party completes their end of the agreement. A smart contract can do that with the help of a distributed network. Although most commonly spoken about in the same breath as cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, smart contracts have the potential to take blockchain technology beyond  and enable a world where trust is digitally secured. Although originally proposed by computer scientist  in his publication “Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Free Markets,” smart contracts only became feasible following the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, is , a distributed ledger that uses a network of nodes around the world to certify transactions. It’s a core component of what makes smart contracts function. In the same way Bitcoin leverages a network of nodes — with Bitcoin they’re known as miners — to validate Bitcoin transactions, smart contracts would  use a network of nodes to confirm whether elements of it had been completed. They don’t need any one party to oversee the contract, just as Bitcoin doesn’t need a single party to oversee transactions. The network — and the smart contact itself — provide the validation that either or both parties have completed their part of the bargain, thereby providing trust without the need for a mediator. By distributing the validation services, smart contracts are much more transparent. They’re traceable and viewable by all parties involved — and potentially by external parties too, should there be concerns over the contract’s contents. Bitcoin technically offers basic smart contract functionality. It’s used regularly on darknet and clearnet sites to facilitate the sale of items. Once a transaction has begun, Bitcoin is sent to an escrow account, which then urges the seller to send their product. When that product arrives, the buyer confirms its receipt and Bitcoin is automatically transferred to the seller. No middleman required. Where a Bitcoin smart contract is limited to the use of its own currency, smart contracts built on platforms like Ethereum can go much further. Ethereum offers a decentralized virtual machine that is  That is, its code base supports a broader use of instructions and can, therefore, be used for a wider variety of purposes beyond the transfer of Ethereum’s token, Ether. Smart contracts are programmable and therefore read just like programmed applications. ‘If this happens, then do that.’ With such broad applications, smart contracts could, in theory, replace contracts in a variety of situations. It could replace direct debit systems for automated payments, for example. If there is enough money in an account and a certain date is reached, the contract would transfer a set amount of money to another account and deliver a digital service in return. When buying a house, the main smart contract could digitally transfer the deed to a home once the required funds had entered the seller’s account, with other smart contracts performing all manner of anti-fraud checks and confirmations of their own. Neither of those instances are different from how financial transactions take place, but where traditional methods are arbitrary, controlled, and viewable by a single party or limited number of several, smart contracts would be entirely transparent. Smart contracts make parties truly accountable for their actions by simply not executing if the contract is not abided. That makes it much harder for any one actor to cheat the system, since nobody has the level of control that banks or legal institutions have currently. With no chance of arbitrary middleman interference, and neither party having more control than the other, smart contracts should, in theory, create greater trust between parties and streamline the entire process at the same time. As powerful as smart contracts could be, they aren’t quite ready to replace every trust system we have in place already. As described in the examples above, a complicated transaction utilizing smart contracts would likely require multiple smart contracts linked together to cover all of the potential ‘if’ situations that would crop up as part of the transaction. There’s also  to consider, whereby smart contracts themselves cannot interact directly with the real world. If smart contracts are involved in transactions involving real-world actions, such as professional to client services, they need an entity (an “oracle”) to tell them that that event has taken place. That’s a real security risk. If you rely on a single oracle for a smart contract, then you have effectively eliminated the decentralizing benefit of a smart contract entirely and created a single point of failure. A decentralized oracle network makes it hard to trust anyone within that network. Alongside the yet-to-be-fixed Oracle Problem, there also exists the security problem faced by smart contracts. Like any programmed code, smart contracts can have vulnerabilities, and that becomes even more likely as complexity increases. Following a recent research effort into Ethereum smart contracts, one company  that could allow for the theft of tokens with ease. There is even debate as to whether such contract exploitation is illegal, since . Fortunately for those excited by the potential for smart contracts, there are many developers working on fixing some of their glaring problems and many others keen to try out smart contracts for all manner of purposes. It will take many years and many changes if smart contracts are to be made a viable alternative for many of the legal systems we have in place currently to make sure two transactional partners trust one another, but the potential is certainly there. As cryptocurrencies  and help introduce wider audiences to blockchain technology and some of its derivative uses, smart contracts may follow suit.",

    "title": "Blockchain Could Turn Video Games Into A Full Time Career | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Video games are more than a game. They are, at different times for different people, a challenge, a business, a lifestyle, or all the above. While professional gamers fight for titles, and the money that goes with them, millions of others are buying, selling, gathering, grouping, chatting, and organizing. While not everyone has realized it, humanity has long passed the point of projecting real value only on tangible objects. Virtual goods can command staggering sums. This article is part of our series “Blockchain beyond Bitcoin“. Bitcoin is the beginning, but it’s far from the end. To help you wrap your head around why, we’re taking a deep dive into the world of blockchain. In this series, we’ll go beyond cryptocurrency and hone in on blockchain applications that could reshape medical records, voting machines, video games, and more Many games, like  and , have built themselves on top of paid transactions for characters, items, and currency. Yet the details of how these purchases interact are often unclear.  What should players own? How should goods be traded? Who should dictate pricing? The answers depend on the game you play and can vary wildly from one game to the next, sowing distrust and confusion. Players want consistency, flexibility, transparency, and privacy. They’re not getting it. Blockchain might be the answer – and more. The promise of ownership may be what lures gamers towards it, but they’ll get more than they bargained for. Seeing the potential for profit, companies soon appeared to ‘farm’ in-game gold and items. By the mid-2000s, gold farming was in full swing,  that saw workers spend 12-hour days grinding away in games. Free-to-play games turned that reality into a business model, selling official virtual goods for real cash. Today, gamers find themselves hurdling down the rabbit hole.  has raked in millions of dollars selling virtual goods for a game that’s not even complete. Despite that, the rules surrounding these transactions, and the items themselves, are nebulous. Most games prohibit selling or purchasing in-game items, pushing transactions to the black market. Middle-man businesses like  have risen in response, promising a risk-free transaction between buyer and seller. Players often take advantage of these, feeling that they own the items they’ve earned. Scams are common – these are black market transactions, after all. Even purchases that seem to go smoothly aren’t guaranteed safe. Game developers often intervene, issuing temporary suspensions, or outright bans, to anyone discovered. Most people aren’t discovered, though, so some players are willing to take the risk. In fact, it’s not uncommon for players to feel cheated when caught. They’ve spent real money, or many hours, to earn what they’ve acquired. Why shouldn’t they feel a sense of ownership? While players take pride in the in-game wealth they’ve gathered, they rarely have legal ownership. That cuts to the core problem. While players take pride in the in-game wealth they’ve gathered, they rarely have legal ownership of virtual goods, no matter how they’re acquired. Blizzard Entertainment’s End User License Agreement makes that clear, declaring itself “the owner and license of all right, title, and interest […]” That includes all currency, virtual goods, even entire player accounts. Pay Blizzard $25 for a mount, or spend that same money on black market gold through ZamGold – either way, your don’t own a thing. Blockchain turns that on its head. It’s effectively a digital ledger without a master copy. Transactions aren’t stored on any on computer, but instead stored on a network of computers, and they’re verified the same way. Transactions are recorded across the entire network through a shared record that no single computer holds. Transactions remain valid even when a PC goes offline –  – making always-online game clients obsolete. Strangely, it’s decentralization that makes true ownership possible. The database exists independent of any single person or organization, which makes its records objective, fair, and true. In blockchain circles, this is counter-intuitively labelled as “trust-less.” The implication isn’t that the blockchain can’t be trusted but, instead, that blockchain makes trust unnecessary. It doesn’t matter if you trust everyone else one the blockchain, because fraud is impossible – on the blockchain itself, at least. It’s a clever, and realistic, implementation. Vlad Panchenko, CEO and Founder of blockchain-based item exchange , explained the advantage, saying “all the transactions will be secured by blockchain technologies, eliminating any possibility of fraud. With DMarket’s blockchain all gamers’ virtual items become real. It’s like Bitcoins or Ethereum in your wallet.” Decentralization also gives developers a chance to put responsibility at arm’s length. A crash in value, or sudden surge, can be blamed on the whims of the market. Scams would still be possible but, because the blockchain itself is secure, attacks would focus on things well outside the developer’s control, like a player’s social media accounts or email. Today, when a weak password leads to a compromised account, players can ask the game’s developer to help restore it. Blockchain would make that difficult, if not impossible. Players would have all the responsibility that comes with ownership. The obvious implications of owning virtual goods are sure to put dollar signs in the eyes of gamers. If gamers truly own in-game items, they should also be able to sell them. It’s  on a whole new scale. It’s easy to envision a hardcore player defeating an enemy, walking away with a legendary weapon, and immediately selling it to the highest bidder. “If you think about a traditional video game […] there are no inherent protections to the user.” This could become a career on its own, and would be particularly lucrative for celebrity gamers. “Information about each item’s owner and history will be secured on the blockchain,” Panchenko explained. “This will create an additional demand for these items from rare asset collectors or celebrity gamers.”  with rare ships awarded only to tournament victors, and blockchain could apply that rarity to any game. Yet profit is only the tip of the iceberg. Blockchain not only holds the power to change ownership, but also to alter how games are designed – a fact that Bryce Bladon, co-founder of viral crypto-game , has experienced first-hand. Most modern games are entirely centralized. Everything, from the graphics, to game design, to virtual goods, are owned and controlled by the developer. “If you think about a traditional video game, there’s next to nothing to stop a developer from just diving in and tweaking things, copying things, and adding other things. There are no inherent protections to the user,” Bladon told Digital Trends. He’s right. Automatic updates are frequently forced on games, and players can’t opt out. Open Steam, or boot your game console, and you’re sure to see new patches arrive. You can delay them manually, but that means can’t play online or enjoy any feature updates. Sooner or later, you’ll have to accept the patch. That’s created tension between developers and gamers, , attempting to re-create the earlier version of a game whether the developer approves it or not. In most cases, these player projects have sputtered due to uneven support or, in many cases, . Control of the game is entirely out of player’s hands, both legally and technically. Blockchain destroys that status quo because it can’t be altered. “We don’t get to just change the block chain, as it were,” Bladon explained. “That is sort of the nature of it, it’s immutable.” CryptoKitties simply doesn’t have the power to alter the game whenever it’d like, and that immediately changes the relationship between those who make the game, and those who play it. Developers become shepards instead of gods. They can attempt to nudge the game in whatever direction they want it to go, but they can’t change the rules, or alter in-game items once awarded. Mitchell Opatowsky, Project Manager at , affirmed what Bladon said, using the revolutionary aspects of cryptocurrency as a template. “If a Bitcoin’s theoretical potential value is that of a decentralized world currency,” Opatowsky told Digital Trends, “the same logic can apply to the game space, where currently individual production houses control the asset sales in a centralized way.” Whether a developer feels a moral or legal right to alter a game becomes irrelevant, because the blockchain makes altering a game technically impossible. Ownership is irrevocably shared from the moment the game goes live. That is – pardon the pun – a game changer. Its impact is so meteoric that the consequences become difficult to imagine. Perhaps it would pave the way for the virtual worlds imagined in sci-fi novels, worlds that aren’t games but instead their own entities with rules, currency, and societies that exist only virtually, yet impact the real world. At the least, it could lead to shared social games that evolve for as long as there’s enough people to play them, and which can’t be shut down, even if the original developer desires it. Blockchain’s potential is huge, in gaming and elsewhere. Yet, as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have already proven, its revolutionary nature makes its impact hard to predict. Five years ago, Bitcoin was a novelty. Since then, it’s surged in value, completely upset video card pricing, sent regulators scrambling, and consumed the savings of those who bought at the wrong time. The disarming cuteness of virtual cats disguises the fact they can be worth tens of thousands of dollars. The consequences are no less for gaming. Virtual goods are already , though the items bought or earned have no tangible value. Blockchain, by allowing ownership and the exchange of items for currency, would erase a legal buffer game companies have used to contend online gambling laws don’t apply. We asked both Bladon and Opatowsky about this issue, and neither seemed concerned. Bladon told Digital Trends that CryptoKitties “strongly believe[s] in consumer protections and making sure the user is protected wherever possible. Gambling, and anything related to gambling, is something we are hyper aware of.” Still, it’s not hard to see the risk. The disarming cuteness of virtual cats disguises the fact they’re in some cases worth tens of thousands of dollars. That could make blockchain games an easy target for lawmakers who might accuse them of cashing on their appeal to children. Whatever the future of crypto-games, it’s sure to go in directions unexpected. Like the internet, blockchain is revolutionary because the specifics of its design allow incredible flexibility. The world is already struggling to keep up with crypto-currency, but its narrow focus on currency compromises its scope. Not everyone wants to deal with playing market trends. Trading cartoon cats, though? That’s something we can all understand.",

    "title": "Blockchain could be implemented in electoral voting as soon as 2019 | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Two major election scandals have plagued the United States over the past twenty years. In 2000, there were widespread reports of a miscount. In 2016, it was alleged that various individuals had committed voter fraud by casting ballots in more than one state.  This article is part of our series “Blockchain beyond Bitcoin“. Bitcoin is the beginning, but it’s far from the end. To help you wrap your head around why, we’re taking a deep dive into the world of blockchain. In this series, we’ll go beyond cryptocurrency and hone in on blockchain applications that could reshape medical records, voting machines, video games, and more. Running parallel to these incidents is an effort to use technology to uphold the electoral process. The rise of blockchain in the collective consciousness has led some to argue that it might provide a solution, but others maintain that it’s not the silver bullet it’s being made out to be.  of information that the public could access without security concerns. Its combination of anonymous use and decentralized data storage has encouraged a bevy of start-ups to examine blockchain as a way to make voting fair, accountable, and secure. Could blockchain help tackle these problems? We asked experts working in the field. Joe Kiniry, the CEO of Free And Fair, has spent his life focusing on computer systems that need to be impeccably secure; the technology that makes sure planes don’t fall from the sky, pacemakers don’t fail, and elections aren’t compromised. “I got interested in elections per se because I grew up in Florida,” said Kiniry when he spoke to Digital Trends last month. “The 2000 election, Bush v. Gore in Florida, was a debacle. I thought, ‘hey, computers could help there,’ and then I realized how hard and interesting the problem was.” In October 2008, while Kiniry was teaching in Denmark, the original bitcoin white paper was published. He read it, and soon began to experiment with blockchain alongside some of his post-doc students. More recently, he’s been tasked with analyzing specific implementations of the technology as part of his work at the computer science consulting firm Galois. “Every industry […] has somehow found a way\n\nto think blockchain is applicable to its problems.” “Various clients are interested in their use, and want to have objective assessment about their utility; how secure are they, are they correct, can I build a business around this technology?” he explained. “It’s people doing due diligence, and that would include the federal government, and the Department of Defense.” Given Kiniry’s experience with voting systems and blockchains, does he think that the technology could be a gamechanger? Not necessarily. “Every industry that I work in has somehow found a way to think blockchain is applicable to their problems,” he said. “I think most of that enthusiasm is misplaced, and guided more by  than actual utility.” Blockchain isn’t a miracle cure that will fix democracy in the US, said Kiniry, but it’s not entirely useless, either. The 2016 presidential election was preceded, and followed, by numerous accusations of widespread voter fraud. Subsequent investigations found , but that hasn’t quelled suspicions on both sides of the political fence. The US lags many countries in its ability to track who can vote. Voters must register ahead of time, while in other parts of the world, registration is automatic – voters instead must present their government-issued ID to confirm their identity, and therefore their right to vote. “There’s new, novel work using blockchain as a means by which to authenticate people,” said Kiniry. Blockchain is typically used to record and store information, and this implementation ensures anyone trying to cast a vote has that right and hasn’t already exercised it across state lines. The technology has been used to great effect by cryptocurrency companies because transaction verification easy. Its usefulness in that instance mirrors why it could help track voting. Combatting voter fraud using blockchain would work, but implementing\n\nthe complex process may be far more trouble than it’s worth. On the surface, it seems this idea would eliminate any specter of the doubts circulating during the 2016 election. However, Kiniry has a good reason why the U.S. might not it. There are other, much simpler ways to yield the same effect. “It’s all kind of an awkward fit, of using something that’s currently popular to solve a problem that you could probably solve – or do currently solve – in a simpler fashion,” he said. Blockchain isn’t intended for this kind of use. It would work, but implementing it could become a complex process that’s far more trouble than it’s worth. It’s an attempt to force a square peg into a round hole. While the 2016 election was surrounded by controversy, the election of George Bush over Al Gore remains the most serious and example of voting problems in modern history.  concluded a statewide recount of disputed ballots likely would’ve found Al Gore to be the winner. Even if that’d occurred, however, it would’ve been ripe with its own controversy. Re-counting paper ballots isn’t easy, and every day that passes between a disputed result and a re-count will bring with it more skepticism of the ultimate result’s validity. “On our side of it, we’re more about using blockchains as ledgers,” said Herb Stephens, president of the , speaking to Digital Trends last month. The organization wants to use the technology to offer a transparent way to monitor the results of an election. In theory, voting by blockchain would be more transparent and tamper-free, but it’d also require a serious re-think of how we approach democracy. Democracy.Earth’s focus is on what’s called ‘liquid democracy,’ which is quite different from the system of representational democracy that we use today. Instead of voting for an elected official that will weigh in on issues on behalf of their constituents, liquid democracy allows voters to have a say for themselves, or delegate their voice to someone with expertise on the subject. If you didn’t feel that you had enough knowledge about global economics to make an informed decision, but you trusted a well-known economist, you could cede your vote to them. Liquid democracy sounds good in theory, but it relies on an entirely new technical infrastructure, as noted by IOTA Foundation co-founder Dominik Schiener in an . Democracy.Earth wants to use blockchain to make it practical, dispensing tokens to voters that they can use to cast their ballot, or pass on to the expert they want to vote on their behalf. “The value of your opinion is not only recorded in a place and time [like traditional voting] but because it’s stored in blockchain, it can be moved – it’s liquid, if you will,” said Stephens. But Democracy.Earth’s plans for liquid democracy would require an overhaul of our current electoral system. This isn’t something that we could tack onto current methods of voting. It might be possible to make a less dramatic change, using blockchain only as a ledger without dramatic changes to voting otherwise, but Kiniry doesn’t see much utility in that. “The core idea is attractive, that of using it as a reliable mechanism for, basically, a ballot box. But to build any digital voting system requires an enormous number of other pieces. The core thing, of the ballot box, is actually kind of an easy thing that people have been doing for many years, in a reliable fashion.” Kiniry notes that the very nature of a governmental election is centralized. A decentralized ledger doesn’t seem to add any unique benefit, but it does introduce further complications. It’s advantageous for bitcoin to be decentralized because the lack of government control is a feature for many of its fans, but an election must be tied to a governing body. A single point of control might be easier to keep secure in an era when digital manipulation of election results seems to be a grim reality. Shouldn’t we select\n\nthe most applicable technology to voting rather than retrofit blockchain? Any technology introduced to the electoral process has to undergo stringent vetting before it’s accepted, and will be subject to resistance from those who would prefer to maintain the status quo. If we are to overhaul the system, there’s an argument that we should select the most applicable technology rather than attempting to retrofit blockchains to this particular use case. In some ways, Kiniry and Stephens find themselves holding two very different positions when it comes to blockchains and voting, but they’re united on one issue. Both think, for better or worse, the technology will be implemented — and it won’t take long at all. “We are going to see the deployment in America of a blockchain-based voting system, in some jurisdiction or another,” said Kiniry. “I would guess in experimental fashion maybe in 2018, but more likely 2020.” Stephens agreed, also predicting that “we’re going to see blockchains used in voting within the year.” Kiniry’s apprehension about the  is due to his prior experience. “The core issue in 2000 actually came down to poorly designed paper ballots,” he explained. “Rather than solve the problem by designing the ballots better, they solved the problem by throwing computing at the problem.” He suggested that many legislators look to technology as “a shiny thing that solves problems.” Eagerness to adopt blockchain may be enhanced by the age of existing voting hardware in the US. Kiniry said that most of it was installed in the late 1990s. Stephens recalled working on a project in the technologically savvy city of San Francisco, where the technology was already fifteen years old. Blockchain’s popularity has occurred just as the country is re-examining how voting happens, making its adoption more likely. “I think we’re going to see a new wave of deployment of prettier, fancier technology that makes people comfortable with the idea of computers in elections, and there will  records around,” said Kiniry “But once again, we don’t have federal standards ensuring that these systems operate correctly and have security. Standards haven’t evolved.” Although it seems inescapable, there are lingering questions about whether blockchains can have a positive effect on American democracy. In the United States, the sheer heft of the election process means that it’s difficult, or at least very time-consuming, to enact new technology. The existing process works just well enough, even with its faults, to make leaders reticent to address persistent issues. “[Within a year or two] we are going to see … a blockchain-based voting system, in some jurisdiction or another.” That’s not the case in countries where corruption and injustice run rampant. “When you look at other parts of the world, for example Venezuela, where the government itself isn’t trusted and it’s broken down, the currency is worthless,” said Stephens. “There, citizens are looking for the solutions, so you don’t have to go in and sell it to the government. We’re really providing the solution for the people.” Democracy.Earth is designing its platform to be open-source, which helps with grassroots attempts to make voting fair. However, it’s also essential when it comes to accountability and security. “You can’t have trust in the system, unless you can understand it completely, and it’s completely public,” said Kiniry. “So, every crypto system in the world that’s widely deployed is open-source. The point of it being secure is not about keeping it secret, that’s a complete red herring. It’s about having disclosure, and having a security case that is completely independent of the fact that everyone can understand what’s in front of them.” When it comes to voting, it’s important we don’t buy into the blockchain hype at our own expense. The  could benefit from the access to technology that we have today, making sure that everyone can exercise their right to vote, and producing a result that’s reflective of the country at large. But if we throw blockchain at the problem without looking at the issues at hand, we’re not going to make any progress.",

    "detailContent": " .  Online ads are a special kind of terrible. They’re invasive, they’re distracting, and worst of all — they’re necessary. Despite the fact they’re almost universally hated, ads are what make the World Wide Web go round. They’re a vital part of the internet ecosystem, and without them, many of the blogs, websites, and Youtube channels that you enjoy wouldn’t generate enough revenue to stay afloat. In fact, if not for ads, you wouldn’t be reading this article right now. But there’s a problem. Our current online advertising system — a pillar of the internet as we know it — is rotting from the inside out. It’s ruining the internet, and it desperately needs to be fixed. In the internet’s early days, web users only had to deal with the occasional banner every now and then. Today, ads are everywhere, all the time. We have banner ads, wallpaper ads, search ads, interstitial ads, video ads, pop-up ads, email ads, newsfeed ads — and much, much more. To make matters worse, advertisements are no longer confined to our web browsers. They appear on most internet-connected mobile games and applications as well. In addition to being inundated with ads everywhere we go, we’re also being tracked. Most websites use third-party trackers to monitor your activity in a wide variety of ways and use that data to build up a unique “fingerprint” that can be used to identify you regardless of where you go on the web, and regardless of what device you browse on. Right now, as you read this article, there’s likely around 40 different trackers watching what you do and harvesting data about your activity. This isn’t unusual, either. In fact, it’s the norm. Worst of all? You’re paying for this to happen. Every targeted advertisement you see on your  is likely bounced through a variety of ad exchange networks, buy- and sell-side servers, placement verification services, and data management platforms, before reaching your device. These data transfers do more than make pages load slower — they also eat into your data plan and drain your battery. It typically costs you just a fraction of a cent per ad, but those fractions add up. A  from the New York Times found that 50 percent of mobile data transferred during visits to popular news websites was a result of ads. Depending on the cost of your mobile data plan, that means you could be paying  just to see ads you never asked for. If there’s anyone who can help fix this problem, it’s Brendan Eich, the founder of Mozilla and creator of JavaScript. Eich has spent the last three years developing an alternative to our fraud-ridden, inefficient, and user-hostile online ad system. He and his team describe it as a “decentralized, transparent digital ad exchange based on blockchain.” Don’t worry — it’s not as nebulous or confusing as it sounds. Broadly speaking, Eich’s solution is an attempt to wipe the slate clean and put a better system in place — one where you aren’t assaulted with ads, and where the lion’s share of the money spent by advertisers doesn’t fall into the hands of middlemen. The system is made up of two main parts, the first of which is a new browser called . In Eich’s own words, Brave is “a privacy focused browser that puts users first and blocks third-party ads and trackers by default.” That means you receive not just a clean, ad-free, and fast browsing experience, but also that your privacy isn’t compromised by an onslaught of tracking bugs and cookies. It’s true that you could achieve a similar result in Chrome or Firefox by installing a handful of extensions, but Brave does both ad blocking and tracker blocking simultaneously — and at all times — from the moment you fire it up. It also keeps nifty stats on the number of ads you’ve blocked over time, and how much time you’ve saved because of faster, tracker-free page loads. So how is anyone paid if ads are blocked by default? Glad you asked. That’s where the second component of Eich’s system comes in. The Brave browser is powered by a blockchain-based unit of account called the  (BAT). In the words of its creators, BAT is “a new token that can be exchanged between publishers, advertisers, and users. It all happens on the  blockchain. The token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the Brave platform. The utility of the token is based on user attention, which simply means a person’s focused mental engagement.” BAT isn’t a currency. It can be exchanged between two parties just like currency, but it’s more than a . BAT can be used as a  between advertisers, publishers, and users on the BAT platform, and can be utilized to directly measure, exchange, and verify attention. As Eich explains “a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin would not enable this kind of distinct, in-platform problem solving.” Put simply, BAT not only allows you to  to websites, but also  for your attention. Or at least it will, in the not-so-distant future. Eich’s blockchain-based ad exchange system is still under construction. He and his team are rolling it out in phases, and right now they’re in phase two of three. Phase one was the Brave browser, phase two was Basic Attention Token, and phase three involves reintroducing ads that users are paid to view — but we’ll get into that last part in a moment. Right now, in its not-quite-completed state, Brave works like a weird version of Netflix that runs on the honor system. You don’t have to pay to use it. You can fire it up and watch all the movies you want completely for free, without ever being interrupted by a commercial. But if you do decide to pay for the service, your money doesn’t go to Netflix — at least not all of it. Instead, 70 percent of your donation is divvied up and passed out to the producers of the movies and shows you watch the most over the next 30 days. That’s basically how Brave works right now. You aren’t required to pay anything to use the browser, but if you do, your money is converted to BAT and doled out to all the publisher websites you visit in the form of automatic micropayments. Eich believes this an alternative to existing subscriptions, like those offered by the New York Times, NewScientist, and others. “Asking people to turn over their credit card to every site that you might read a few articles from is not reasonable,” he argues. “A lot of times, the paywalls want $250 a year or something. That’s not reasonable. […] This way, if you have funds in your Brave user wallet you will be monitoring (over 30 minutes of personal uptime, privately on your device, without sending information to anybody, not even Brave) what sites you go to, and then rewarding them automatically.” BAT not only allows you to  to websites, but also  for your attention. Brave’s creators know that only a small percentage of users will opt in to this voluntary payment system. “We don’t expect most people to do this,” Eich admitted. To supplement the system, Brave also introduced a stimulus package in 2017 to incentivize early adoption and coax new users onto the platform. After Basic Attention Token’s explosive ICO (which raised over ), Brave set 300 million BAT aside for the “user growth pool.” “We created 300 million BAT,” Eich continues, “that we can then use to give to users to put change in their pocket from the get-go, which they can use to reward creators who refer new users to us. If those new users browse for 30 days with us, then that automatically causes the U.S. equivalent of five dollars in Basic Attention Tokens to go to the creator who referred them.” The plan seems to be working. Brave now boasts about 2 million active daily users, and it’s getting bigger every day. But to truly disrupt the current ad-based internet model and supplant it with a newer, fairer, blockchain-based ad exchange, Brave needs to roll out the rest of the platform. The next piece of the puzzle is reintroducing ads in a more controlled, efficient, and private manner than what currently exists on the internet. Brave will soon let you opt in to seeing a small number of advertisements, which will appear in either a private tab, or an in-browser notification. Brave plans to allow some ads on publisher pages, but the first rollout will be user-private ads. It’s important to note, though, that these ads will not be “targeted” in the same way that current online ads are. “Instead of sending out tracking signals to allow advertisers to buy access to your attention, we bring an objective catalogue — one per region and natural language that you live in — to your machine,” Eich explains. “It doesn’t fingerprint you to download the catalogue. […] When you opt-in to this — it’s consent-based, and not on by default — you will get one private ad per day, in a tab, at the right time and place.” Any ads that you choose to allow in Brave will still be relevant to you — they just won’t rely on fingerprinting and tracking services to stalk you and figure out what you might be interested in buying. It’s a completely different system. The best part? Thanks to Brave and BAT, you’ll get paid for the ads you pay attention to. In the case of user-private ads loaded in a separate browser tab, you’d get 70 percent of what the advertiser spent to serve that ad to you, while Brave takes the remaining 30. BAT has the potential to fundamentally change how you use the internet. Eventually, Brave plans to let publishers sell ad space as well. “If publishers want to do ads in their space that we block,” Eich explains, “with their consent, and with the user’s consent, we will give 15 percent to the user, we’ll take 15 percent, and we’ll give 70 percent to the publisher. We’ll always give 70 to the owner of the ad space — be that the user or the publisher — if they’re willing to do a deal with us.” Later, when the platform is finished, Brave will let you “cash out” and convert BAT into dollars, bitcoins, or any other currency. By default, though, the Brave Payments system is built to take a user-specified amount from your wallet and redistribute it to the websites you visit most over the next 30 days — thus completing the cycle from advertiser to user to publisher, and helping the system go, as Eich puts it, “steady state.” Once Brave is complete, it will provide an alternative path through which you can explore the internet. One where you can wander freely, without being tracked, without being bombarded with ads, and without screwing over publishers by blocking the ads that bring them revenue. Will this new system disrupt the current digital advertising model and replace it with a blockchain-based online utopia? Will Google Chrome become the new Internet Explorer and be banished to the sideline as everyone jumps headfirst onto the Brave bandwagon? Probably not — at least not any time soon. In fact, that’s not even Eich’s main goal. As the co-creator of Firefox and a decorated veteran of the browser wars, he isn’t interested in unseating Google Chrome to become king of Browser Mountain.   “I don’t want to corner the browser market,” he explains. “I think Brave will have a good growth curve and lots of market share among elite users who are very economically valuable, but BAT is the big play. I want the Basic Attention Token to be used widely, which means we will bring it to other browsers and other attention apps — things like podcast players, or games that have ads in them.” Eich’s grand plan is to eventually release an open-source SDK for Basic Attention Token, which will allow developers to not only build new applications that run on attention, but also integrate BAT into existing apps. Think of it like an exotic new engine technology. If it runs, this engine could revolutionize more than just automobiles. It could power boats, motorcycles, and supersonic jets as well. No matter what your preferred mode of transportation may be, BAT has the potential to fundamentally change how you cruise down the information superhighway we call the internet. It just needs a bit of a kickstart first. “Nobody knows what the future holds,” says Eich, “but if we prove this model, it should lead to future web standards. And I think that in the future you should be in charge of your data.”",

    "detailContent": " This article is part of our series “Blockchain beyond Bitcoin“. Bitcoin is the beginning, but it’s far from the end. To help you wrap your head around why, we’re taking a deep dive into the world of blockchain. In this series, we’ll go beyond cryptocurrency and hone in on blockchain applications that could reshape medical records, voting machines, video games, and more.  Your medical record grows longer with each visit to your doctor. Your weight, blood pressure, symptoms, and other data gradually builds up in your electronic medical records, or EMRs. It’s a neat, tidy term, but EMRs are messy. Every hospital and every doctor’s office has a different way of storing them, which means it’s not always easy for healthcare providers to obtain your medical history. This situation, coupled with a medical emergency, can have potentially disastrous consequences. Luckily, there’s a research group at MIT that aims to bring order to the chaotic world of EMRs, with a little help from the blockchain. Before we talk about the potential solution, let’s talk about the problem. Electronic medical records (EMRs) — also known as electronic health records (EHRs) — are the backbone of every modern healthcare system. They’re the reason your doctor is always seated in front of a computer during a general checkup. They’re filling out information about the visit, their recommendations, your condition, and adding notes. Entering data in your records during visits has, as recently deposed Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price stated, . “A prescription refill used to take five seconds of the doctor’s time. Today, it can take 20 to 200 seconds of clicking through boxes, reviewing chart notes and entering orders, depending on the workflow and any questions that arise,” writes . “Doctors and nurses spend less time talking to each other these days. Rather than calling a colleague regarding a consult, we enter the referral order. Rather than discuss the patient with the nurse, we type in our orders.” That problem, according to , is a factor contributing to professional burnout. Managing records is time-intensive, and not only during patient visits. Healthcare professionals need to catalogue personal notes, procedures ordered, procedures performed, and prescriptions. Every tiny detail that exists in your medical record was put there by a healthcare professional — and not always for your benefit. Changing doctors, providers, and facilities can all complicate your medical records. These systems aren’t designed to streamline medical record storage and access for healthcare providers and patients. They’re primarily designed for billing. Overworked healthcare professionals end up spending hours at home or during the weekend, catching up on data entry not for your health, but for your insurance company. It’s an inefficient system. The Canadian Medical Association Journal speculates it could be  effective than old paper-based systems. “The systems are also designed to make billing easier, not to make clinical care more efficient, so tasks such as refilling prescriptions actually take longer than before EHRs,” the . And remember, these meticulously maintained records aren’t interchangeable. Changing doctors, providers, or facilities can complicate your medical records. The city of Boston, Massachusetts has at least 26 different medical record systems currently in use. As , of those systems has its own language for sharing, representing, and sorting data. Moving your medical records from one facility to another is complicated. They must be translated into the new system, and that can mean added strain on already overstressed medical professionals. Added, and unnecessary. It could all be as simple as sending an email. Here’s where  comes in. If you’re unfamiliar, blockchain forms the literal backbone of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, , and . They work by keeping track of transactions in a distributed ledger, a log where hundreds, thousands, even millions of computers all hold a piece of and validate with one another. When one computer (a node) adds a piece of data (a block) to the ledger (the chain), other nearby nodes start talking to each other, distributing the updated ledger. Each block can contain different kinds of data — financial transactions, a CryptoKitty, anything, that’s why the blockchain is an intriguing option for imposing order on the chaotic world of EMRs. Privacy is an important concern, however. As they work today, anyone can look at the bitcoin or Ethereum ledger at any time. Addresses and transactions on the ledger have no personally identifiable information in them, they don’t say your name or phone number. But they do contain the cryptocurrency “addresses” of both involved parties — the person sending the cryptocurrency, and the person receiving it. These addresses are rendered a long strings of incomprehensible letters and numbers. But if you happened to know who those addresses belonged to, you’d know who they were sending money to and when. That’s not ideal for medical records. If someone knew how to identify your records on the blockchain, they’d know everything about your medical history. That’s why , an MIT research project, aims to use the blockchain in a slightly different way. Instead of storing specific data in the blockchain, like every single procedure you’ve undergone, MedRec keeps stores “pointers” in the blockchain. Think of these like the hyperlinks in this article. “The raw medical record content is never stored on the blockchain, but rather kept securely in providers’ existing data storage infrastructure,” the MedRec research paper reads. Let’s say you go in for a check-up. Your doctor enters data in his or her medical records app, and a small, anonymized piece of info goes up on the blockchain under your unique identifier. It’d be no more than a link to the internal records managed by your doctor. If you change providers, your new doctor just needs to look up your identifier in the blockchain and data, which is stored as a “pointer.” Think of it as a hyperlink to an entry in your old provider’s files. Your new doctor would enter her secure access key, and then have access to your personal ledger of medical records. In this way, MedRec is more of an index, a high-tech, high-security card catalog your medical providers can use to look up your medical history. Since every entry is stored as a block on a chain, it’s easy for your providers to see what care you received most recently, when you took certain medications, and what medications you’re currently taking. Even if you went to an urgent care clinic in another city, state, or country, the care you received would be added to your personal MedRec ledger. If you’re familiar with how blockchain and cryptocurrencies usually work, you know there’s something we haven’t talked about just yet — mining. Miners play a vital role in the crypto market. They not only chip away at complex code to discover new coins, they validate transactions, and serve as a check against tampering. Miners are literally the beating heart of the blockchain, and without them transactions would take a lot longer to validate. If there weren’t people “mining” the medical records blockchain, your records could take longer to update every time you visit a healthcare provider. If there weren’t enough computers working to keep things going, the MedRec system could become just as slow as the system it was designed to replace. The MedRec team has an innovative solution — use researchers to mine the healthcare blockchain. In return for using the computing power to keep the blockchain going, researchers would be rewarded with access to anonymized medical data, would be a potential goldmine to life sciences and medical researchers. Take your name off a lifetime’s worth of medical records, and there’s probably still enough to identify you. However, even anonymized data is personal medical data. There may still be enough data to identify you. That’s why MedRec engages patients and providers to decide how much metadata they want to release. It’s a work in progress, but the MedRec team is confident enough people will be willing to share their anonymized metadata to make the system work on a large scale. “We note a growing interest among patients, care providers and regulatory bodies to responsibly share more data, and thus enable better care for others,” the MedRec research reads. “[With MedRec] researchers can now obtain greater clarity in their investigations by earning census level, anonymized metadata in return for contributing the computational resources that sustain the network. MedRec offers a novel approach to a widespread problem, and it’s an innovative use of blockchain technology. MedRec is just one potential solution, but it lays out a roadmap that gives us a look at what the future of medical records management could be. That’s not exactly the most exciting use of blockchain, but this is an issue that involves everyone. EMRs and EMR management systems present a growing problem for healthcare providers and patients alike. Not only does an increase in clerical work contribute to physician burnout, but hospitals which participated in a similar  saw a ten percent downtick in overall risk-adjusted mortality. When healthcare providers can’t get access to a clear, up-to-date picture of your medical records, mistakes can happen. If blockchain can help solve this problem, it might be worth forking over some anonymous healthcare data. Maybe.",

    "title": "Can Blockchain Bring Transparency to Global Supply Chains? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  If one were to try and visualize the modern international economy, it might resemble the tangle of cables behind a computer or television. The supply chains that carry goods from producers to consumers weave across and around each other, stretching over borders and oceans. A product may pass through several countries before it takes its place on a retail shelf, awaiting purchase. That holds true for the clothes we wear, the electronics we use, and even the food we put in our bodies. This article is part of our series “Blockchain beyond Bitcoin“. Bitcoin is the beginning, but it’s far from the end. To help you wrap your head around why, we’re taking a deep dive into the world of blockchain. In this series, we’ll go beyond cryptocurrency and hone in on blockchain applications that could reshape medical records, voting machines, video games, and more. Imagine ordering a cheeseburger at a restaurant: How much do you know about the ingredients? What dairy did the cheese come from? What farms the lettuce and onions? Which factory did the beef pass through to be ground up — and is it even entirely beef. Globalization has benefits, both to developing economies and to international peace, but a consequence of global trade is that consumers often have little insight into where the goods they buy come from, or how they are made. The companies that sell those goods may not even know. These gray areas are a problem, because they provide opportunities for mishandling or even outright fraud. There may be a technology that can solve this problem, however: Blockchain. Introduced to the mainstream as part of , blockchain has become synonymous with cryptocurrencies — and by extension, people getting rich quickly. Among blockchain’s key traits is the ability to render data transparent and nearly immutable, and this could make blockchain a great tool to make supply chains visible to the world and reduce opportunities for fraud, in the food industry and beyond. The food we eat travels a long distance from farms and factories to our plates, and in many cases the person eating it has no idea what winding path it took, or even what is really in it. Food fraud, in which agents somewhere along the supply chain adulterate or misrepresent their product, is a shockingly common occurrence. A consequence of global trade is that consumers often have little insight into where the goods they buy come from. In  for the Journal of Food Science, Dr. John Spink, who runs the , defined food fraud as “a collective term used to encompass the deliberate and intentional substitution, addition, tampering, or misrepresentation of food, food ingredients, to food packaging; or false or misleading statements about a product, for economic gain.” Food fraud is distinct from a food safety issue; while the latter can result from mere sloppiness or neglect, as in a salmonella outbreak, food fraud is intentional. “…the concern is there’s always an economic threat, but there’s not always a public health threat,” Spink told Digital Trends. As such, “it’s not that people don’t focus on it, but it’s not a priority compared to something like food safety where people are getting ill right away.” And while fraud doesn’t always lead to public health crises, when it does, it can be disastrous.   Those incidents can range in severity. They could be innocuous, like olive oil that is falsely labeled as “extra virgin,” Spink explains. But they could also be something as scandalous as the discovery of horse meat in ground beef, as happened in Britain and Ireland . Or the 2008 incident in which Chinese dairy producers added melamine to infant formula in order to inflate its apparent protein content. , and as it is generally the only thing in food that produces nitrogen, agencies use nitrogen levels to determine if a product has sufficient protein. Melamine can cause kidney problems, however, and the result was  for issues including kidney stones. Current food safety systems respond quickly and thoroughly to food safety incidents, Spink adds. The problem is that these responses generally require a visible health threat; if people aren’t aware of adulteration in a product, there’s no cause to investigate. Spink explains that traditional food testing is limited. “When we test for food safety, we don’t really test that the food is safe. We test that it doesn’t have the presence of about 30 to 50 bad bugs or chemicals. Because those are the ones that we really know are mostly out there. So we don’t really test for everything.” Government agencies in Europe may be on the lookout for horse meat in products after the last scandal, “but if you’re in Europe, you don’t also test for zebra.” It’s hard to pin down exactly how common food fraud is, but Spink estimates that “for some products it could definitely be ten percent of the market, even in the U.S.” In order to better combat food fraud, authorities must shift their focus from responding to food fraud, to preventing it. “And if we think crime prevention,” Spink says, “that’s social science — and these are human adversaries, so using social science is the right way to focus…That’s very different than food science, and food safety, where we’re chasing a microbe and we’re trying to cook it…” Spink’s work involves something called situational crime prevention. “It’s the space of crime, the physical space of crime,” he says. “And we look at vulnerabilities, to see what’s the state of being of a location — say, a building — that allows it to be a target for crime.” According to this theory, crimes often happen because criminals see opportunities. By anticipating those opportunities and adding deterrents, authorities can prevent crime. Spink considers a bank to be an apt analogy. If your bank is simply a building with a big pile of money in it, someone might see an opportunity to stroll in and take the cash. Add an armed guard, however, and suddenly there’s an extra factor the would-be robber must consider.   Of course, the robber might see the armed guard and decide they can deal with them, maybe by bringing arms of their own. That big pile of cash is once again ripe for the picking, so you add security features to make the cash even harder to steal. Put the money in a vault, now they have to think about how to open it. If they would force a teller to open the vault, make it time-locked, so that “even if they had a gun to their head, literally, they couldn’t open it.” It’s almost like a chess game between the criminal and the crime fighter; one looks for vulnerabilities, the other anticipates those vulnerabilities and closes them off, trying to stay moves ahead. Though more abstract than banks, supply chains have vulnerabilities too, and fraudsters are always looking for ways to save or make money. For authorities, the goal with supply chains is to make fraud more difficult. “…we’re looking at the food supply chain, to look at where are all these vulnerabilities, and what can we do to prevent them,” Spink says. Being able to trace products is key. “And then we start to look at when we have known incidents…we try to figure out ‘Well, why did someone put melamine in there? How were they able to put melamine in there?’ And then we start to look at what might we have been able to do that would have led…an intelligent adversary to say ‘You know what, let’s not even try to attack this product.’” In order to dissuade potential criminals from committing food fraud, making supply chains transparent and ensuring data is honest are crucial; blockchain might be just the tool to do both. Blockchain can be a confusing concept, lying as it does at the intersection of cryptography and finance, two fields known for being impenetrable. Put simply, a blockchain is an example of a distributed ledger, a record of transactions of which a copy is given to anyone who wants one, and every copy stays current. In a typical, cashless transaction where one party is giving money to another — such as cashing a check or buying something online — no physical exchange of currency happens. A third party, such as a bank or credit card company, makes a note that one party has less money in their account, while the other has more. Any cash-free exchange of money requires such a go-between. To some people, this is a flaw. As Adam Greenfield explains in his book , “The critical vulnerability of all pre-Bitcoin digital cash schemes was that they required parties to a transaction to repose their trust in an intermediary institution, who they’d rely upon to maintain the ledger and update it every time value was passed across the network…As a consequence, there is tremendous fear that whoever controls the mint [the institution] would have the power to prevent some transactions from taking place entirely…” With blockchain, everyone has an identical copy of the ledger. Whenever a transaction occurs via blockchain, other computers on that network verify that the transaction is valid and add it to the ever growing log that is the blockchain itself. Imagine two people: Alice and Bob. Alice wants to give Bob some money, and they want to do so using Bitcoin. Every person on a blockchain has a unique ID called a digital signature. When Alice gives Bob Bitcoin, the transaction involves several variables: Alice’s digital signature, Bob’s digital signature, the Bitcoin leaving Alice’s account, the Bitcoin entering Bob’s account, the time and date of the transaction. These variables are plugged into a formula, which produces a string of digits called a “hash.” Each specific hash can only be produced by the specific values entered; if Bob were to try and modify the record to say that Alice gave him more Bitcoin then she actually did, the resulting hash would be different. When the transaction occurs, it is grouped together with others in a block, and members of the network (called nodes) run through the entire record of the blockchain, verifying that the hashes in the new block line up with the already existing blocks in the chain. Once a node establishes a block is valid, it submits it to the chain. Because everyone on the network has a copy of the ledger, everyone can see every transaction that has occurred, from first to last. If one were to try and modify data on a blockchain, the other nodes would note that the data doesn’t align with theirs, and disregard it. Blockchain is thus decentralized, transparent, and secure. For Tomaz Levak, CEO of OriginTrail, these traits make it perfect for supply chains, where obscurity and fraud are problems, and he and his team of collaborators have developed a protocol specifically for supply chains. The founders of OriginTrail got their start in 2011, working with food companies to show where the ingredients in their products came from. By 2013, the company that would become OriginTrail was taking shape. “And then two things started happening,” Levak explains. “One was that one of the most common questions that we got was about data integrity — how can we vouch for the data…” The second was their desire to unite entire supply chains on one platform. “And both of those things are connected to trust.” Levak and his team gravitated toward blockchain, a technology built to be transparent and incorruptible. They used a blockchain platform called Ethereum, securing important data with cryptographic hashes that couldn’t be forged or manipulated. “However, we couldn’t go much further beyond that, because it can very quickly get very expensive to play around with decentralized networks,” he says. Despite the drawbacks, the team still believed in the potential of blockchain for brokering trust and the sharing of data. They identified three key issues that their protocol would need to address: Standardizing data between companies on a supply chain, curbing the costs to store data, and protecting company secrets on a platform intended to be transparent. Each stop in the supply chain confirms that its data matches that of the stops before and after it. Blockchains aren’t a cost-effective way of storing data; because it is very hard to delete data on a blockchain, nodes will need to process ever increasing amounts of data when validating, using larger amounts of energy, and thus money. To get around this, the team needed to go beyond blockchain, and built the OriginTrail network in layers. While a blockchain layer handles things like “immutably storing data fingerprints and handling transactions between users and nodes in the network,” the bulk of the data is stored on an off-chain “data layer,” trimming the fat on the blockchain itself. To verify data on the network, OriginTrail requires a “consensus check,” wherein each stakeholder in the supply chain “has to be approved by the previous and the following supply chain stakeholder,” according to the company’s white paper. This means that each stop in the supply chain confirms that its data matches that of the stops before and after it. Although blockchains create transparency, businesses need to feel that important data isn’t on display for the entire world; companies often have data they don’t want out in the open, since it could reveal too much about their operations. Levak uses the mass of a shipment as an example. It’s important for parties to see that the mass of a shipment hasn’t changed from one stop to the next, but you might not want the mass itself to be visible to everyone. To guarantee that businesses can feel safe putting their sensitive data on the network, OriginTrail employs a zero knowledge proof; in this process, Levak explains, “one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.” A famous example of a zero knowledge proof involves two colored balls. Imagine Diana has two balls, one green and one red, and wants to prove to her color-blind friend Charles that they are different. She places one in each of his hands, then he puts them behind his back, holds them back out, and asks if he switched them. Diana can tell if they have been switched based on the color, so even though Charles will never have that particular information, he can verify that she is correct. While the OriginTrail network may enforce transparency, the question arises of how it will compel the industry’s bad actors to get onboard. Why join a network that could expose your crimes? Levak is aware of the conundrum. “…if you’re a good actor,” he says, “then there is a clear motivation for you to be able to prove something like that using a decentralized technology.” Bad actors will naturally be resistant, so the early adopters will be businesses that value the efficiency OriginTrail can bring to their operations, and those who recognize the bragging rights that come from embracing transparency.   Companies certainly have incentive to look into blockchain. Although many a post on Reddit has proclaimed that blockchain will liberate mankind from the control of banks and even governments, big organizations are actually intrigued by the technology. “Such complex organizations,” Greenfield says, “are currently compelled to make enormous outlays on systems that improve data quality, they are often exposed to significant liability for data errors they fail to prevent, and above all they bear the impact of these circumstances directly on the bottom line. As a ‘trusted framework for identity and data sharing,’ the blockchain promises to solve these problems all at once.” Spink’s research echoes this; aside from the people eating the food, the most concerned parties about food fraud are the big businesses. “…one minute of production at a major food company could be a million pounds,” Spink says. “And if they just had the wrong pepper in there — they said it was a lemon pepper and it was really a szechuan pepper — then they have a million pounds that they have to destroy.” The decentralized nature of blockchain leads to fervent support — perhaps because its users feel empowered — and Levak sees in OriginTrail’s early adopters a community eager to spread the word, describing them as “a little network of ambassadors all around the world.” While blockchain’s potential is astonishing, it remains to be seen how effective it will actually be with supply chains. As Spink puts it, “For that horse meat incident, how would blockchain have helped? And where would it help? And what would we need to do to allow it to help reduce fraud?” No matter how secure your walls seem, there will always be someone, somewhere looking for gaps. If blockchain really can help, it can’t come too soon. The problems with supply chains go beyond food adulteration, to issues of labor and environmental destruction. Take consumer electronics, for example: The lithium-ion batteries found in smartphones, for example, contain cobalt. According to , more than half of the cobalt in the world comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and 20 percent of that comes from miners who “mine by hand using the most basic tools to dig out rocks from tunnels deep underground…miners operating outside of authorized mining zones typically lack basic protective or safety equipment, such as respirators, gloves or face protection, and do not enjoy legal protections nominally provided by the state.” Even more alarming, “Researchers found children as young as seven who scavenged for rocks containing cobalt.” The Amnesty report lists numerous corporations whose cobalt supplies run through a particular smelter in China. “Alarmingly,” the report continues,” the majority were unable to answer basic questions about where the cobalt in their products came from and whether there were any risks of the kind observed by researchers.” The knowledge that blockchain can provide may empower consumer to make more informed decisions about the products they buy, and companies to make better decisions about who they do business with. However wide blockchain spreads, it may not root out corruption entirely. Technology can’t change the hearts of men, and no matter how secure your walls seem, there will always be someone, somewhere looking for gaps.",

    "title": "Blockchain Problems – How to Solve Issues With the Latest Vogue Tech | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Amidst the continued fervor for cryptocurrencies and , evangelists have claimed it can help replace everything from money itself, to the foundation of many of our digital tools. But with Bitcoin fees skyrocketing off of its expanded use last year, and bugged Ethereum smart contracts leading to , is this really a technology that’s ready for mainstream adoption? There’s not even a . If, however, we assume it to be a distributed ledger system, there are key areas which many of those at the forefront of blockchain’s development believe are lacking. We sat down with blockchain developers to find out more about the technology’s flaws. This article is part of our series “Blockchain beyond Bitcoin“. Bitcoin is the beginning, but it’s far from the end. To help you wrap your head around why, we’re taking a deep dive into the world of blockchain. In this series, we’ll go beyond cryptocurrency and hone in on blockchain applications that could reshape medical records, voting machines, video games, and more. “The biggest issue I see right now is the scalability problem,” Justas Pikelis, co-founder of blockchain Ecommerce platform, , told Digital Trends. “Right now, Ethereum can process 17 transactions per second.  can handle 175,000 requests per second. Visa, 44,000 transactions per second. So, if we really want to use cryptocurrencies as currencies, it would not be possible as of this moment.” The best example of blockchain’s scaling problem is the escalation of Bitcoin transaction fees and confirmation times that occurred during the currency’s explosive value rise at the end of last year. Fees rose from a dollar or two to as much as $50.  and blockchain platforms don’t suffer as severely from this issue, and there are  to mitigate it, but it’s not an easy fix even with them in place. “When you store the data on the blockchain, it’s quite expensive,” explained Alexander Demidko, CRO of blockchain database company . “That’s why all of those solutions are trying to store the data off chain and send it periodically to the blockchain. But it’s still hard to search through the data stored there. That’s why we [think] ideally there should be a way to upload the data to the decentralized environment, then search the data I need there. That’s what we’re trying to solve with a decentralized database, as it’s not currently supported by the blockchain.” Blockchains like the one used by Bitcoin, which leverage a ‘, require enormous amounts of computing power – that’s expensive in hardware and electricity. Although alternatives exist, blockchains are still computationally intense when compared with traditional databasing solutions. Storage is also a potential problem. Bitcoin’s blockchain of simple transactions is upwards of 150GB. Any business institution using blockchain technology for a traditional database can expect every node to require much more space than that. That problem would be compounded if, as a company, you were to operate a private blockchain – controlling every node yourself.\n\nEdgar Bers, head of public relations at , believes blockchain technology, as it exists now, wouldn’t be useful or scalable for a large database. “Most blockchains we have today are not good for businesses that rely on massive amounts of data […] Most businesses rely on terabytes of information and centralized server architecture […] Multi-terabyte blockchains are inefficient,” he said. “When your business requires ultra-heavy communications you really have to throw all the tech you can on the blockchain to survive the load. If you design a blockchain for a certain maximum of transactions per second, increasing your business operations could be staggering due to required blockchain upgrades – which you may not even have to hand.” That’s less of a problem if you operate a public ledger blockchain because you can decentralize your blockchain over nodes that are found across the world. That’s certainly a viable solution, and one used by governments like Estonia. Yet that runs into another issue entirely. The problem of privacy. Most people imagine blockchain technology as the publicly distributed system that Bitcoin is built on. The  are located all over the world, and the entire blockchain is publicly downloadable, viewable, and verifiable. That total transparency creates all sorts of problems for organizations handling even the slightest confidential data. “Full decentralization is almost utopian, where it can only be used in a very primitive function, like Bitcoin,” Pikelis explained. “When you’re talking about more complicated things, a little more information stored on the blockchain, it’s really hard to reach that full decentralization. Still people have to believe that companies are running these decentralized applications for them to be able to on board and really store the things and hash the things that are private [like] public information.” Even the developers at Fluence, who are working on developing blockchain database technology that could, in theory, handle potentially sensitive information, don’t believe it’s quite ready to yet. “As with every technology that has yet to mature, you don’t want to store overly sensitive data there. Once it becomes more mature, you can trust it more,” Demidko told Digital Trends. That’s not to say they aren’t working on a solution. The first and most predictable, considering the blockchain’s reliance on cryptography, is encryption. “In the example of a driving license database, I am a user, I have my driver license and I want to put it into a decentralized database,” Demidko explained. “I can encrypt it with my personal key and not tell this key to anyone, but authorities who need that. If I put my driver’s license into the decentralized database, it’s encrypted there, so no other person can read it without my permission. The nodes where the data is being stored have access to the data, but they can’t read it because they don’t have any keys.” However, encryption alone is not the final solution to privacy concerns. Private keys could be , and the development of  could lead to  that would threaten the sanctity of data stored on a truly decentralized blockchain. There’s no easy fix to these problems yet, so privacy will remain a serious obstacle for many promising projects. Although blockchain technology is becoming easier to leverage and understand all the time, it’s still not an easy topic to get your head around. Blockchain services and tools demand more technical know-how from the users than many contemporary digital platforms, and that could prove problematic for adoption, especially if security scares and lost funds become associated with blockchain’s public image.   “Blockchain and Bitcoin [is] really hard for those who are not related to technology or software developers to use,” Fluence’s CEO, Evgeny Ponomarev told Digital Trends. “Just sending a transaction is pretty hard. The next year we all as a community need to build tools to make it easier, because it’s the only way to better adoption.” Such tools will have to involve easier user security. Although blockchain technology is often more secure than traditional passwords, losing a private key can create all sorts of headaches. A decentralized system often lacks an arbitration process for recovery. While blockchain is often more secure than regular passwords, losing a private key can create all sorts of headaches. “There is some cryptography research that has been done with key recovery,” Ponomorev suggested, as a potential solution to this issue. “Splitting the key into many pieces, giving them to many people. They can help you recover it from pieces if you lose it. Some companies are trying to use a custodian system, where you can get your keys and place them somewhere or with someone safe, to protect you from losing keys.” His company’s CRO quickly pointed out, however, that these techniques are imperfect, potentially opening new avenues for attack from outside actors. Security and ease of use don’t always go hand in hand, he said. Many early proponents of blockchain technology lauded its ability to operate outside of the usual restrictions and regulations of centralized governments and financial institutions. Although that lack of oversight is still welcome by many, a growing number of developers believe that some form of standardization and control is necessary to make blockchain a mainstream technology. “I think [regulation is] certainly possible,” Monetha’s co-founder, Pikelis said. “There is so much uncertainty […] people still don’t agree on one kind of consensus on what they should do about cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICO). I think we’re going to see a lot happen in the regulation space for ICOs, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain quite differently in different parts of the world.” Part of that will be financial regulation, he said, suggesting that bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will create guidelines for what is allowed. That will particularly affect companies looking to sell their own tokens. Although , it’s not hard to look at the glut of new cryptocurrencies and blockchain marketing schemes and see the benefits of limitations. The expansion of blockchain into new areas also invites new regulations or running afoul of existing law. If it were used to track medical records, for example, it’d immediately become bound by existing laws in many countries across the globe. “The whole attention to blockchain technology is a little bit premature, and the size of it brings a lot of pressure, and that’s why some things are starting to crack and some things might not seem rational,” Pikelis told us. “It will take some time for people who don’t have the tech savvyness and technical knowledge to be able to fully trust smart contracts and blockchain technology.” It’s not hard to look at the glut of cryptocurrencies and blockchain marketing schemes and see the benefits of limitations. We are starting to see the early signs of that, and as , the first steps will likely be know your customer (KYC) rules designed to prevent money laundering. That’s unlikely to please those who have enjoyed operating on the fringes of society with anonymous cryptocurrency wallets and relative impunity from governing and regulatory bodies. However, as with any new and exciting frontier technology, if blockchain wants to see more mainstream adoption, simplification of interaction and some form of remediation may be necessary – and that means governance. That won’t solve everything though. Blockchain technology, by its very, distributed nature. That’s a strength in some cases, but also it hard to blockchain to handle some problems centralized systems have been designed from the ground up to achieve. It seems likely that much, like the early days of the internet, some of the largest and most impactful blockchain platforms will one day become mainstays in everyday society. If that analogy if followed to its conclusion, though, it also means hoards of others will fall by the wayside to leave only the most useful and versatile standing. Blockchain is not a miracle cure for every technological ill and, as recent history has shown, powerful innovations come with unintended consequences.",

    "title": "From the doctor to the DMV, blockchain can make governments swift and secure | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Although most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain technology is also being used all over the world for many intriguing purposes. One of the most impactful could be the way in which governments themselves are using it to ensure that the data of citizens and political figures are protected, from both other nation states and themselves. In some cases, that’s already been realized. From protecting the integrity of citizenship data on government databases, to proving that your next second-hand car won’t kill you, blockchain has the potential to enable trust in data like never before – even if you don’t trust the government behind it. “People always come here and say, ‘oh, Estonia, it is the country of the blockchain. This is some sort of misunderstanding,” Federico Plantera, of the , told Digital Trends in an interview. Although Estonia has leveraged its “Keyless Signature Infrastructure” (KSI) system since 2012,  over whether it can be described as a blockchain.  This article is part of our series “Blockchain beyond Bitcoin“. Bitcoin is the beginning, but it’s far from the end. To help you wrap your head around why, we’re taking a deep dive into the world of blockchain. In this series, we’ll go beyond cryptocurrency and hone in on blockchain applications that could reshape medical records, voting machines, video games, and more. As Plantera described it to us, KSI is . It grows on a linear scale related to time, rather than the number of transactions. Due to its predetermined number of nodes, it retains a fast and consistent confirmation time for data changes and additions. As advanced as it is, however, it isn’t as far reaching as some might think. Estonia’s digital infrastructure started development at the turn of the 21 century. What began with electronic tax filing in 2000 slowly morphed into a system that handles the country’s population register, electronic ID cards, internet voting, and health records. All this is facilitated by X-Road, the core component of the Estonian government’s digital data. The  is a system of connected government databases. It facilitates the confirmation of data points, without moving the data itself around. As Plantera describes it, “It’s basically a government office that keeps all the data there and is available 24/7. If there is […] a company that provides public transport that has to check my place of residence, [for example] that check can be done, say at nighttime, because the system is fully automated, and the data is always available.” The blockchain’s role in this digital ecosystem comes down to security and data integrity. In the diagram  that describes the Estonian system, it is represented as “security servers.” A cryptographic hash function, or “digital footprint” of the data – crucially, not the data itself — is duplicated across many nodes, much like the blockchains used in cryptocurrencies. However, most blockchains have no limit on the number of confirmation nodes. The KSI blockchain’s Estonian developer, Guardtime, maintains a limited number of nodes, or participants, as it describes them. Those participants are controlled both internally by the government, and by external entities. If any data is altered without notifying all the other nodes, it can be quickly discovered and rejected. One unique participant is a ‘physical node’ — the Financial Times newspaper. Every issue contains a printed copy of the data’s hash. Even if some external or internal actor were able to compromise or gain control of every node connected to the KSI blockchain, they would never be able to effectively rewrite the blockchain’s history, because it could be checked against the physical, printed copy. Any nefarious actor would have to somehow change tens of thousands of printed newspapers to hide their tracks. Recovering from an attack using the printed hash wouldn’t be fast, but as a failsafe and warning against attempting to make major changes to the blockchain, it should be very effective. “The blockchain basically protects all of the information exchanged at the government level,” Plantera said. “All the government institutions use the blockchain to protect the integrity of public information that is exchanged on the X-Road.” Estonia implemented this system in response to cyber attacks in 2007 which stalled the computer systems of major banks and some media outlets, and even made the country’s ATM services unavailable for some time. Although Plantera told Digital Trends the country saw no long-term consequence from the attacks, it prompted the development of the KSI system, and Estonia’s eventual implementation of it in 2012. “Since we started using the blockchain, we always know when there is a cyber attack and where it’s happening, because we can detect it straight away,” Plantera said. Though Plantera told Digital Trends that Estonia has no plans to expand its use of blockchain technology as part of the E-Estonia system, GuardTime is constantly iterating and expanding its services. It  to deliver similar protective technologies to large enterprises and government agencies, and the mobile carrier plans to announce its own set of KSI-backed security products later this year. “Government institutions use the blockchain to protect the integrity of public information.” GuardTime isn’t the only organization experimenting with the potential of blockchain solutions to governmental problems.  a startup developing blockchain database technology, sees great potential for improving trust between government departments. If more government entities can rely on the integrity of data from partner agencies, then sharing information should make many facets of government more efficient, while also improving security. “[Governments] can install a permissioned blockchain to their departments and have some trust and storage between different government agents and departments,” Fluence CEO and co-founder, Evgeny Ponomarev, told Digital Trends. “The thing about a decentralized database, is it can be permissioned, it can be used by government [to engender trust].” Governments around the world often . Strong, permissioned data sharing over the blockchain could make that a thing of the past.  most commonly known as the operator of cloud mining company HashFlare, was recently asked to conceptualize a system for the Belarus government to handle a protected, distributed database of car components and service histories. “[Belarus wants] to have a vehicle registry [built on blockchain technology],” HashCoin’s Product Development and Public Relations Manager, Edgar Bers, told Digital Trends. “That register would contain more than just VIN numbers, but also the serial numbers of the engine parts, so you could always check whether something has been changed or not. All the cases where accidents [take place] are also logged – it’s like a car passport. It has all the information about the car’s history. Car inspections, fines, everything.” While many countries have systems for maintaining detailed information on a car and its parts’ history, they aren’t always mandatory, and rely on paper as much as digital records. A blockchain-based system would guarantee the integrity of the data, highlighting where proper records hadn’t been kept, making it harder for fraudsters to cheat potential car buyers. “Automotive production companies, retailers, car shops and mechanics [would use it].” Bers said. “All these places would have access to APIs, so if you are a licensed service who is allowed to make technical checks of car equipment, you would do that and then put all of that data you have received and put it all into the system as an authorized body, so next time something happens with the car and it appears in the blockchain that the car service says that engine is fine, but it turns out that the engine is not fine, it will be easy to see who to blame.” Classic car scams, such as rolling back the mileage, would be nearly impossible to pull off if a distributed network had note of a car’s real mileage, updated each time the car entered any legitimate business for repairs or servicing. Such a system could easily operate across borders, making it much harder for the scam of importing cars and rolling back the mileage to trick local buyers, far harder to achieve. The main purpose of blockchain in governance, at least in its current guise, is data integrity. That’s what it’s used for in most cryptocurrencies, too. It creates trust in the currency’s validity because no one entity can change it without everyone knowing. “No one from the government could change what the blockchain says.” In the case of government data, that makes it harder for other nations to hack it or rewrite the data’s history. Estonia says it’d be difficult for anyone to interfere with its digital voting infrastructure, or health records, without giving themselves away. Adding a blockchain layer to a government’s digital ecosystem even prevents the government from altering the historical record. It can’t change one database entry and cover up the logs – it’d have to change every single entry. Even that’s impossible because physical nodes, like the Financial Times, exist. In Estonia’s case, “It works bi-directionally,” Plantera explained. “It works for the citizens. It prevents against cyber threats from the outside, and works for the government in a sense that no one from the government side could change what the blockchain says, and what has already been encrypted and protected by the blockchain, in terms of data integrity and privacy.” At a time when  that the public’s trust in government is at an all-time low, blockchain technology offers a potential avenue for improving trust in at least the data we are presented with. If the data that underlies policies and discourse can be guaranteed, that could form a better basis for discussion, and make it easier to avoid some of the confusing, often  that has become so common worldwide.",

To help you wrap your head around why, we’re taking a deep dive into the world of blockchain. In this series, we’ll go beyond cryptocurrency and hone in on blockchain applications that could reshape medical records, voting machines, video games, and more. Late last year, on October 26th, a small U.K. tech company called On-Line PLC decided to change its name. From that day forward, it would be known as . That seemingly insignificant move had a massive and almost instantaneous impact on the company. Within 24 hours, its share prices rose by 394 percent. Within 48 hours, its value had grown more than it had in all the past two years combined. On-Line PLC didn’t change its business model, hire a new executive, or announce a new product. It just tacked “blockchain” to its name, and suddenly investors threw truckloads of money at it — a testament to the blockchain’s hype. Not much has changed since then. Blockchain technology — the backbone of Bitcoin, and much more — is just as hyped as it’s ever been. You’ve probably heard about it on the news, read headlines about it online, and been lectured about it from that one guy in your office who’s  into cryptocurrencies. It’s like Beanie Babies and Dutch tulips at this point.   That might lead you to dismiss it as a fad, but don’t let the hype fool you. Blockchain has legitimate potential to change the world. As the  puts it, “Blockchain is not a ‘disruptive’ technology, which can attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly. Blockchain is a foundational technology. It has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems.” “It has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems.” Yet it’s still early days for the technology. Many have likened the recent blockchain boom to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s — which is a fair comparison. That bubble did burst, but after the crash, the world wide web eventually rose from the ashes of the 1990s and became one of the most transformative technologies the world has ever known. Blockchain, it seems, has that same potential — it’s just in its the dot-com phase right now. Over the course of the next week, Digital Trends is taking a deep dive into the blockchain space. We’re going beyond Bitcoin and homing in on applications that might reshape democracy, economics, advertising, and more. Blockchain’s impact on these concepts could truly change how they function – but, of course, revolution is often messy business.",

Governments and private organizations are seeking to put the blockchain to work solving some of our society’s biggest problems. The city of Austin, Texas, is launching a program meant to help the homeless protect their identities in the event that their IDs are lost or destroyed. The program is part of a grant awarded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and aims to solve one of , which concerns keeping their identities secure. “If you have your backpack stolen or if your social security card gets wet and falls apart, or if you are camping and the city cleans up the site and takes your possessions, you have to start all over from the beginning again,” Sly Majid, Austin’s Cheif Services Officer told Tech Crunch. “It really prevents you from going about and doing the sort of activities that allow you to transition out of homelessness.” Unfortunately for many homeless people, the loss of an ID or Social Security card can make it impossible for them to get the help they need, because they have no way of proving who they are, and they can’t always afford to pay for new forms of identification. The city is hoping that it will be able to use the blockchain as a replacement for paper records which can easily be stolen, lost, or destroyed. The idea is that the blockchain can provide a secure and safe way for aid workers to verify a person’s identity. One of the examples that Majid pointed to was in the area of securing and protecting medical records, which can be difficult to verify for the homeless. Majid is hopeful that this system will make it easier for healthcare providers to keep track of a patient’s medical history and records. Overall, Austin aims to use the technology can help solve the problem of homelessness, though Majid warned that the program is still in its infancy. However, he is hopeful that the program will grow over time.",

    "title": "Another Initial Coin Offering Scam Grabs $660M From Investors | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " A budding cryptocurrency firm located in Vietnam is accused of raising funds from an initial coin offering and . Modern Tech, based in Ho Chi Minh City, set out to launch two cryptocurrency platforms: iFan for making payments between celebrities and fans, and Pincoin for general transactions backed by a rewards system. The company raised $660.79 million from around 32,000 investors before throwing on its invisibility cloak. An initial coin offering is a means to raise funds to launch a cryptocurrency platform. Investors shell out money in return for tokens (think stocks) that appreciate in value over time. Once the cryptocurrency platform is fully funded and goes live, these tokens can convert into virtual currency. The tokens served up by Modern Tech promised to “skyrocket” once the platforms went live. On the iFan front, the value of this specific cryptocurrency was expected to rise “on a daily basis” as the company signed on Vietnamese singers. Meanwhile, the value of Pincoin would rise as investors brought other individuals into the network, providing an 8 percent commission for each new Pincoin member. Ultimately, investors were promised a profit rate of 48 percent a month, and a full recoup all investments within four months. After that, investors could seemingly shower in money. At first, Modern Tech began paying commissions with real money. Investors watched as both cryptocurrency platforms increased in value on a daily basis, as promised. But eventually the company replaced cash payments with tokens that couldn’t be withdrawn for real world money. That suddenly raised a red flag for all investors. Victims turned to social media and forums to report their investment loss in Pincoin and iFan while on Sunday many parked in front of Modern Tech’s headquarters with signs to denounce the company and demand a refund. Victims are also currently signing an official complaint demanding a return of their investments. According to a report from Vietnam, the team behind the Pincoin and iFan initial coin offerings consist of seven Vietnamese nationals that lured investors by holding conferences in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and other remote areas.  Using initial coin offerings to raise cash for cryptocurrency platforms and disappearing with the money isn’t anything new. The method is called an “exit scam” and previously used by Confido, LoopX, Prodeum, Starscape Capital, Knoxcoin, and many others. The problem is that initial coin offerings, along with all cryptocurrency platforms, aren’t regulated, so there are no federal laws protecting investors. In North America, the  that it was investigating companies and individuals for possibly violating securities laws through initial coin offerings. The SEC says virtual currencies should be listed as securities and registered with regulators given all promoters of initial coin offerings and cryptocurrencies won’t “act responsibly” and abide by federal laws. “The SEC is undertaking significant efforts to educate the public that unregistered securities investments offered by unregistered promoters, with no securities lawyers or accountants on the scene, are, in a word, dangerous,” stated SEC chairman Jay Clayton.",

But an unnamed source familiar with the sale  equaled to around 2 billion to 3 billion yen, which converts to $18.6 million to $27.9 million. “We will enter the blockchain-related area where applications are expected in the virtual currency business,”  of Yahoo Japan’s statement. “In addition, by utilizing the service operation and security expertise of the Yahoo group, we support the operation of exchanges operated by BitARG Exchange Tokyo and the operation after the start. It is easy to use and safe for exchange services.” The news arrives after BitARG executive Yoon Hee Yuan  that the exchange would sell 40 percent of its stock to Yahoo Japan to launch a new cryptocurrency exchange in the region. Yaun said at the end of March that the company was studying “various possibilities” such as investments and partnerships with other companies to strengthen the upcoming platform and its management. BitARG plans to launch its new cryptocurrency exchange platform in the fall that will primarily deal with the  cryptocurrency.  from other Yahoo subsidiaries are expected to be made at the beginning of 2019 with a final product launching in April 2019. The cryptocurrency trading platform received its approval from Japan’s Financial Services Agency in December and is ironing out the business side before going live this fall. BitARG Exchange Tokyo isn’t the only exchange getting a cash injection.  that it purchased 100 percent of Coincheck’s shares for $34 million. According to the company, the deal will fuse Coincheck’s knowledge of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency with its knowledge of the financial industry. The investment should also help Coincheck “enhance” its internal security to better prevent hacks. Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck saw the theft of around $530 million in NEM tokens . The company admitted to a lapse in security, including a much-needed multi-signature approval component, that allowed a single hacker to transfer the virtual coins stored in Coincheck’s “hot wallet” to an external account. Hot wallets are typically connected to external networks whereas cold wallets used by most individuals are not.

    "title": "Cryptominers Now Far More Common Than Ransomware | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Making money from  isn’t just something that people do with their own hardware, malware authors have also been creating malicious software to have other people do the hard work them – and we don’t mean . While this represents a new fad in the realm of malware authorship though, it may not be around in this guise for long. “Cryptojacking is outpacing ransomware reports by a factor of 1 to 100, and these numbers will continue to increase …” In our , we looked at how malware tends to come in waves. While the latest and most dangerous in recent memory has been ransomware, it’s been pushed far from the top spot of common attacks in recent months by the advent of cryptominers, which look to force infected systems to mine cryptocurrency directly. While it may have been riding high recently though, like the value of cryptocurrencies themselves, it’s a malware type that already seems to be on the decline. Digital Trends spoke with some prominent digital security experts to find out what this means for the near future of malware and what they think cryptomining malware might look like in the months and years to come.  “Since cybercriminals are always financially motivated, cryptojacking is yet another method for them to generate revenue,” said Liviu Arsene, senior E-Threat analyst at . “Currently, it’s outpacing ransomware reports by a factor of 1 to 100, and these numbers will continue to increase for as long a virtual currencies remain popular and the market demands it.” These stats were backed up by  quarterly malware report. It noted that cryptomining had become one of the most common malware in recent months. It suggested that it had increased by as much as 4,000 percent in the consumer sector over the last quarter. It was also growing in the business space, with a 27 percent increase in overall detections during last quarter. That increase made it the second most common digital infection. MalwareBytes noted over the past three months, falling only just behind adware. In comparison, ransomware, which has been a major threat for the past few years, saw a notable decline in the consumer space, falling by 35 percent. Part of that could be to do with the more sophisticated targeting of ransomware at businesses and larger enterprises, but it may also be that the top producers of the ransomware software have been halted in their tracks. “I wish there were miners everywhere, that [it was] all we had to deal with.” “There was a , that was likely the , the biggest ransomware family at the time,” MalwareBytes head of malware intelligence, Adam Kujawa told us. “If that was the case, it makes sense that that particular malware family would drop off. After that we’ve seen a couple of new families, but nothing that’s being distributed at the same sort of level.” Since that happened, Kujawa noted that MalwareBytes had seen a general drop off in ransomware distribution and that this was indicative of the marketplace shifting direction.  Although old standouts like adware and spyware are still more prevalent than cryptojacking, the new kid has quickly become one of the most common threats seen. Malware authors will take a freely available cryptocurrency miner that is aimed at consumer usage and modify it so that it runs silently on a system, making it harder to detect and therefore giving it longer to generate income for the author before it’s discovered. The malware is then usually distributed alongside some other form of malware like an exploit kit which allows it to be installed in the first place. But even if you don’t download a malicious file or click a dodgy link, websites themselves can force your machine into the crypto mines, like the extremely prevalent  from earlier this year. “Browser-based cryptojacking is becoming very popular amongst cybercriminals, especially when end users are concerned,” explained BitDefender’s Arsene. “Deploy it within legitimate and high-traffic websites after they’re breached their security, it has immediate return-on-investment as each visitor will mine cryptocurrency for as long as the script-based miner remains on the server.” Cryptomining has a few unique features too, compared to other commercial malware solutions. For starters, it’s almost platform agnostic, with infections cropping up on Macs and  devices, as well as Windows PCs. Kujawa told Digital Trends that as many as 1,000 new Mac-targeted cryptominers had appeared in the past three months alone.  If cryptomining isn’t particular smart or targeted then, is it something we need to be too concerned about? If a victim’s computer runs slow while they’re on an infected website, rather than having their files encrypted or identity stolen, would it not be better for everyone if malware authors focused on that kind of attack than more traditional ones? “The fact that the victim is running cryptocurrency mining software is the least of their problems.” “The spread of cryptominers is no where near the ‘everybody panic’ state [like] when encrypting ransomware first came out,” Kujawa said. “I wish there were miners everywhere, that that’s all we had to deal with, and no ransomware or information thieves.” BitDefender’s Arsene agreed, to a point, suggesting that on the surface cryptojacking was relatively benign. However, as much as this sort of malware might be less of a threat than other types, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have potential to damage — or mask more serious threats. One such threat facing businesses is a loss of productivity, as MalwareBytes’ CSO and CIO, Justin Dolly, explained. If left unchecked, cryptominers also have the potential to cause damage to hardware. As MalwareBytes found when one of its malware-trap systems was infected with a number of miners. “After the cryptomining craze [last year] one of our systems had its  fried, because of how many miners were being loaded up in analysis of this system,” Kujawa said. “[They] would rev up the GPU cycles and CPU and just kill it, so we had to replace the graphics cards.” Perhaps the biggest risk with cryptomining though, is that it can be used in tandem with other types of malware. Imagine a ransomware attack  the user is scrambling to figure out how to decrypt their files, their PC is mining away and earning the attackers even more money. “This will likely fuel the need to create mining rigs made of large botnets.” “If a victim has been compromised using an unpatched vulnerability or via a fileless attack, the fact that the victim is running  cryptocurrency mining software is the least of their problems,” said BitDefender’s Arsene. “Technically, the attacker could have deployed any payload – ranging from keylogging malware to data exfiltration malware.” Even if cryptomining malware doesn’t bring with it a whole host of other problems too, there’s always the chance that it will not be detected for months or even years in the case of some systems.  Cryptomining might be more dangerous than it appears, but like all other types of malware, it is likely to have its heyday. Indeed, as cryptocurrency values have fallen since the end of 2017, the instances of cryptojacking have been falling too. While the overall numbers might be higher than last quarter, they are lower than their peak, as Malwarebytes’ latest malware report shows. “Cryptojacking is definitely here to stay,” BitDefender’s Arsene said. “These numbers will continue to increase for as long as virtual currencies remain popular and the market demands it.” Another interesting wrinkle he raised was that as the difficulty of mining of various cryptocurrencies increases, it could be much more lucrative to get others to do the hard work for you. “Since mining for cryptocurrency will become increasingly more expensive to mine using someone’s own private hardware, this will likely fuel the need to create mining rigs comprised of large botnets, hence fueling the cryptojacking threat,” he said. That’s something that MalwareBytes sees as having a lot of potential too. Especially when you consider some of the  we’ve seen in recent years. But ultimately that all depends on whether it’s actually worth it to keep investing in that avenue of malware authorship. If anything, it’s easier for digital security companies when a new trend is breaking. They know what they need to focus on in the immediate future. But now that cryptominers may have peaked, the experts are unsure of what to expect next. “This is an anomalous time right now, and that’s the scariest part,” Kujawa said. “The scary part is not knowing where the criminals will go when cryptocurrencies no longer interest them.”",

    "title": "Ransomware Shifts Focus from Holding Passwords to Hijacking Your PC | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " A malicious website initially set up to extort visitors to pay a cryptocurrency ransom has changed its course. Instead of demanding payment via Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin in exchange for not leaking your password on the internet, the site now hijacks your computer’s processing power to mine cryptocurrency in the background. Designed as a copy of the  attack, the site began by asking users to enter their emails to see if their password has been compromised. Unfortunately, if your password was breached, the site demanded a “donation” of $10 by cryptocurrency to not publish your password in plain text on the web. Up to 1.4 billion passwords may have been breached, but it’s unclear how accurate that figure is. However, because it may be easier — and safer — to change your password than pay the ransom, as  noted, the site shifted its focus from demanding ransomware payments to taking over your PC’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrency in the background. The publication also confirmed that the malicious site did “have a database with legitimate passwords,” but that not all compromised passwords were stored in plain text. The Next Web did not reveal the site’s address in its report, citing security reasons, but noted that it doesn’t appear that any user had made payment. This is the latest ransomware in recent months that demand cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Prior to this incident,  encrypted files on a user’s PC by hijacking it using a brute force method. If you want to regain access to those files, you had to send payment via cryptocurrency to get a key to decrypt your files. However, at the time, there didn’t appear to be a proper decryption key even if you paid. According to a recent Google report, extortionists made out with $25 million in just two years, and cryptocurrency was the preferred way to get paid. In fact, 95 percent of extortionists used BTC-e to cash out their earnings. The report cites that the European Union’s anti-money laundering directive and counter-terrorist financing legal frameworks can help to prevent the misuse of cryptocurrency. Hackers are also changing the game when it comes to data theft. Rather than leaking the information to the dark markets, an  report revealed that hackers prefer to hold files hostage in exchange for a ransom payment. This meant that in 2017, 25 percent fewer records were leaked than the previous year. In the business world, ransomware cost corporations $8 billion worldwide in 2017, and many companies keep cryptocurrency on hand to reduce downtime.",

    "detailContent": " With the surge in popularity of , it’s becoming more acceptable to pay for things with Bitcoin. However, given the volatility of cryptocurrency exchanges, accepting Bitcoin can result in a loss for the seller if the market takes a downturn. One enterprising individual is hoping to cover any possible losses, and likely secure a gain, demanding a premium for accepting Bitcoin. Hedge fund manager Claio Guazzoni de Zanett is selling his Manhattan townhouse, and potential buyers can pay the $30 million listing price in cash, with a mortgage loan through a bank, or use cryptocurrency to fund the transaction. If you use cryptocurrency, though you’ll have to pay $45 million. That’s a whopping 50 percent premium over the traditional list price. No foreigner to cryptocurrency exchanges, Zanett is the founder of the Zanett Cryptocurrency Group and has been an investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain since at least 2015, according to . “I’m a true believer in these networks, but it’s very volatile,” Zanett said of cryptocurrency exchanges in an interview with the . “They could be down 60 percent in two weeks.” Zanett says he will accept Bitcoin (BTC),  (ETH), or Ripple (XRP) for the transaction. The townhouse is listed as a six-story property in New York City’s Upper East Side neighborhood. While Zanett asking for a 50-percent premium from buyers wishing to pay with cryptocurrency, he wouldn’t be the first to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for . One buyer in Colorado purchased a home for Bitcoin, but in a hybrid transaction scheme. In that purchase, the buyer slowly liquidated his cryptocurrency portfolio, converting his holdings into cash, which he used for the purchase. Cryptocurrency investors could of course work their way around Zanett’s premium by selling their cryptocurrency holdings and converting their investment into cash. The cash can then be used to finance the purchase of the $30 million property, rather than transferring the cryptocurrency funds directly to Zanett. As cryptocurrency gains momentum, it’s unclear if other real estate sellers or vendors would demand such a hefty premium when Bitcoin or similar funds are used in a transaction. In addition to Zanett’s listing, there are five cities around the world where you can use Bitcoin to pay for real estate, including Miami, Dubai, New York, Lake Tahoe, Nevada and Bali, according to .

Hunter Energy is currently working on getting the Hunter Valley-based power station back online. Once completed, IoT Group will obtain power at wholesale cost, which will be more economical for businesses running their blockchain services using the new BAC.  are distributed database systems that typically power cryptocurrency, recording and securing transactions using cryptography. Each transaction has a unique key that is stored inside the next encrypted transaction. Thus, modifying a single transaction would change all previous transaction in the chain. Other applications ideal for blockchains include banking and, based on IOT Group’s announcement, the Internet of Things market.  “Having access to power at wholesale cost combined with Australia’s sovereign benefits is likely to be attractive to domestic and international blockchain operations,” the company says. That wholesale cost will be provided without “additional charges and costs associated with power transmission, including grid costs, poles and wires, and electricity retailer margins.” , the average household pays around 28 cents per kilowatt-hour. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network supposedly gulps the same amount of energy consumed by Demark, which is around 32 terawatt-hours each year. That equals to around 16 percent of what Australia consumed in 2017. Currently, Australia’s power is inefficient and expensive, discouraging services from using blockchains locally. But with the company’s “pre-grid” pricing, customers will pay eight cents during the day, and five cents at night. Given blockchains consume loads of processing power and the resulting high amounts of energy, the new facility should be an attractive alternative to blockchains accessing the typical power grid. IOT Group’s announcement defines wholesale cost as “no more than one-third of current business and consumer power costs.” What is interesting about the news is an emphasis on IoT rather than applications such as cryptocurrency. So far there is no indication that the company will strictly deal with IoT services, or if it will be open to all blockchain-related markets. Blockchains provide a trusted environment, a key component necessary for IoT to transmit data on a secure channel. According to , blockchains could also eliminate IoT gateways and reduce processing overhead. Data exchanges could increase while security could safely scale out as additional IoT devices enter the fold. As Hunter Energy gets the power plant up and running, IoT Group is working with a data complex builder to co-locate a data complex to the site. The company also established IoT Blockchain Advisory Service Pty. Ltd. to develop revenue streams and monetize “blockchain opportunities.” Meanwhile, Hunter Energy is looking to move its power plant away from coal. Once the plant is back online, Hunter Energy will introduce waste wood products into the fuel mix to reduce emission intensity. Eventually, the company will build a grid-scale solar plant seated next to its coal mine lands.",

    "detailContent": " The Wall Street Journal has reported that Coinbase, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has reached out to the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission regarding . This would expand Coinbase’s roster of cryptocurrencies to include those that the SEC has classified as securities. Additionally, this would likely pressure Coinbase’s rivals to register with the SEC and submit themselves to government oversight. Coinbase president Asiff Hirji said that the increased regulations would result in Coinbase listing more currencies because it only wishes to list coins which have “some amount of regulatory certainty.” “The assets that we do list have all had some amount of regulatory certainty,” Hirji told CNBC. “As soon as there is more regulatory clarity than there currently is, you would expect us to start listing more assets.” The Wall Street Journal reached out to Coinbase for comments regarding its claims, but Coinbase declined to comment on the matter of registering with the SEC. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies currently face very little in the way of oversight from the U.S. government, but that is slowly starting to change things to the rise of initial coin offerings, which is where startups sell investors tokens in exchange for cash. The rise of ICOs has prompted the SEC to take a closer look at digital currencies, with SEC chairman Jay Clayton saying that most of the tokens offered through ICOs were securities, and thus could only be legally traded on licensed exchanges. This increased regulatory oversight is what prompted Coinbase to slow down when it comes to listing new currencies. By becoming a  licensed brokerage firm, however, Coinbase is likely hoping to increase the number of currencies it can offer while also staying on the right side of the law. There are some downsides to registering as a brokerage firm. The SEC has wide-ranging powers to investigate brokerage firms in order to ensure they are complying with various regulations. If Coinbase is registered as a broker, the SEC would have the power to examine its trade records, cybersecurity, and policies, which would prevent market manipulation and insider trading. That being said, Coinbase is already under the government’s gaze when it comes to tax matters, as the IRS has started  taking place on Coinbase.",

With Robot Cache, a  distribution platform back by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, you will be able to do so and put more money directly into the hands of developers. “Robot Cache, the first decentralized PC video game distribution platform that benefits publishers, developers, and gamers, has announced the first wave of publishers that have agreed in principle or signed agreements to bring their games to the platform,” the company said in a . The partners thus far include smaller publishers such as 505 Games and Paradox Interactive, as well as THQ Nordic, the company . More partners will be announced in the coming weeks. Robot Cache promises the lowest transaction fees of any PC gaming platform, reducing them by 80 percent, and publishers and developers of all sizes receive 95 percent of all game sale proceeds. This is compared to the  collected on competing platforms, including Steam. Though Robot Cache advertises the ability for players to sell their digital games on the platform, as well, though you won’t actually be taking home that much in return. Players will receive 25 percent of the sale, while publishers and developers will receive 70 percent — effectively making money twice on the sale of one game. As it’s a blockchain-based platform, you will be given tokens called Iron in order to buy more games, and you can choose to mine Iron through the Robot Cache client in order to increase your spending power. So, what games will be available to download through Robot Cache when it ? Given the publishers already onboard, we can presumably expect to see THQ Nordic and Deep Silver games like and the long-awaited . What might be more interesting, however, is seeing how independent developers embrace the platform. Should it gain a significant foothold in the market, the smaller fees and proceeds from secondhand sales could enable more developers to make their dreams of full-time development a reality.",

    "detailContent": " India’s central banking authority, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has announced that it will cease doing any sort of business with anyone or any business that deals with cryptocurrencies. In the same breath however, it has made it clear that plans to create its own cryptocurrency continue unabated. India’s Ministry of Finance has previously criticized Bitcoin for its volatility and lack of “intrinsic value,” as , but this latest move by the RBI is the most impactful yet. It has given those currently involved in the cryptocurrency trade within India three months to sell off their remaining assets or relocate their business, as from that point the RBI will not support the trade of cryptocurrencies. The reasoning behind this move is said to be over “concerns of consumer protection, market integrity, and money laundering.” That last point was doubled down on in a press conference, where the deputy governor of the RBI said that cryptocurrencies undermined efforts to prevent money laundering. He also said cryptocurrencies have the potential to “endanger financial stability” if allowed to grow too large. Although the move doesn’t outright ban cryptocurrencies —  — this end of service support is likely to have a big impact on India’s use of cryptocurrencies. The RBI regulates all banks within the country, so maintaining a bank account in India while trading in cryptocurrencies will be exceedingly difficult. This comes at a strange time in India since, while the RBI has criticized existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it has expressed interest in the underlying blockchain technology. Citing the escalating costs of dealing with, transporting, and producing physical money, it has suggested that it may develop its own cryptocurrency as a potential future solution. If this does come about, the cryptocurrency would be state-backed and therefore act more like a digital version of traditional currencies, with little decentralization. In that fashion, it might operate a little like the , which has received a good deal of support from banks and governments in other countries. For now, many Indian cryptocurrency users and evangelists hope that this decision of a block of services to crypto-users is overturned. As one crypto-economist pointed out, making it hard to buy cryptocurrencies with bank transfers is just more likely to see people use peer-to-peer trades and over-the-counter cash transactions, which are far harder to regulate. 8/ The Indian crypto market is still pretty small but offers a lot of future growth and opportunities, especially for the unbanked. I hope the RBI and the rest of the Indian government rethink this decision and take a more positive approach towards . \u0026mdash; Pankaj Jain (@pjain) ",

If it turns out to be as powerful and efficient as Bitmain claims, it could well help combat the still ongoing problem of . Bitmain is the  for Bitcoin and a number of other altcoins. Its application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners typically offer much greater performance per watt than general-purpose hardware, and that could well be the case with its . Although it’s not slated to release until July, by the numbers, it would be as powerful and more efficient than multi-GPU rigs. The Antminer E3 is said to deliver a hashrate of 180 mega hash per second with a power consumption of 800w. Bitmain claims that these numbers are conservative for now and expect them to be greater when the miners debut later this year. In comparison, a stock clocked RX 580 produces 25MH/s for 175w. Although multiple-GPU mining rigs tend to have various clock and power-draw tweaks to make them more efficient, they still aren’t likely to hit the same levels as the Antminer E3. At least in theory. The price tag could be the killer part of this equation though. At $800, the E3 miner is about as expensive as just one pair of RX 580 , or three GTX 1060s. You aren’t getting anywhere near the same sort of hash rate for that sort of money with consumer graphics cards. The response to this new hardware announcement has been mixed. While Bitmain has restricted purchases to five per customer to ward off scalpers, there has been a wave of negative comments on the  post. Many highlight that selling mining hardware months in advance of shipping is unethical because of the shifting value of cryptocurrencies. One of the biggest criticisms of the new Ether miner is that Ethereum developers are very much against the idea of ASIC miners being used to mine it. The cryptocurrency was designed to subvert the ability for ASIC miners to dominate the workload. Although it has been acknowledged that eventually ASIC miners would be developed to mine Ether, Ethereum developers may now take action through a hard-fork or fundamental change to Ethereum itself, to prevent ASIC miners from being used. Were that to happen, newly purchased Antminer E3s would become effectively useless. Regardless, the E3 miner is likely to be popular — purportedly the first batch is already sold out — even if the value of cryptocurrencies continues to fall across the board.",

There’s even a , which is dedicated to helping Bitcoin owners calculate their proximity to sweet Italian leather and the burn of rubber on roadways. The site notes that its calculations, which are based on the value of Bitcoin over the past seven days, “are completely fictional” — a disclaimer likely due to the simple fact that Bitcoin is a very unstable investment, seeing major upswings in price followed by sharp downturns. But Bitcoin billionaires are buying nonetheless. A general manager at a Lamborghini dealership in California  that it had seen “over 10 transactions” involving cryptocurrencies in December of last year, when Bitcoin soared to more than $19,000 a coin (who knows , of course). For some Bitcoin millionaires, a Lamborghini is more than just a status symbol. It serves as proof that the coin does hold real-world value. In 2015, Piper Moretti, a realtor who specializes in helping people use Bitcoin to purchase homes, saw how the purchase of a Lamborghini even helped persuade a realtor to sell her clients a $3.2 million home in Manhattan Beach. The owner’s agent refused to accept a purchase in Bitcoin out of fears that her client would be scammed. Moretti’s clients, who do not wish to be named, decided to purchase a Lamborghini and sent over the details of the transaction to Moretti, who was able to persuade the home owner that her clients were legitimate. “The Lambo actually helped us get the house,” Moretti . She said that the Lambo purchase helped prove that Bitcoin wasn’t just some made-up internet thing, but real money that could be used to make real purchases such as homes and cars. Cryptocurrencies, particularly , saw rapid growth over the past year. This growth also saw , which has damaged the currency’s reputation and led some businesses to refuse payment in Bitcoins.

    "title": "Bank of England May Use Blockchain Tech to Improve Payment System | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The Bank of England said last week that it’s currently working on a “proof of concept” to see if its real-time gross settlement (RTGS) service will benefit from . The bank’s governor, Mark Carney, , saying that securities settlements need innovation, and blockchain technology – aka distributed ledger tech – could produce “significant” gains regarding platform stability, efficiency, accuracy, and security. Real-time gross settlement systems are means for transferring money from one bank to another. The “real-time” aspect means there’s no annoying waiting period once your funds now reside at the recipient bank. Meanwhile, the “gross” aspect defines a one-to-one transaction and does not include transactions from other accounts. Finally, the “settlement” term simply means the transaction is final and cannot be reversed. Typically, a blockchain relies on a network of computers spread out across the globe supporting a database, aka the ledger, based on cryptography. This ledger stores transactions but is incapable of linking to specific individuals due to its cryptographic nature. Every transaction has a unique key and is stamped by a trusted party. That key is then stored with the next transaction, which is itself encrypted using a cryptographic formula. Rinse and repeat, and you have a chain of transactions that can’t be altered without modifying all previous transactions. “Although the Bank has concluded that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is not yet sufficiently mature to provide the core for the next generation of RTGS, it places a high priority on ensuring that the new service is capable of interfacing with DLT as and when it is developed in the wider sterling markets,” . That’s where the proof of concept comes in. The bank is now working with Baton Systems, Clearmatics Technologies Ltd, R3, and Token, who now have access to the proof of concept: a cloud-based system that replicates a version of its pre-funded net settlement that could eventually serve U.K. retail payment systems. Those involved with the proof of concept will explore the best way of interfacing with the platform and how to better expand the RTGS service. Blockchain technology was first described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. But it didn’t become a more common term until the arrival of Bitcoin, which uses a public blockchain/ledger to store all Bitcoin-based transactions. But the bank’s use of a blockchain doesn’t mean it will rely on a public ledger maintained by millions of PCs across the globe. This blockchain will likely be maintained by the bank itself and all other organizations accessing the platform. “The Bank of England has set out its vision for a renewed RTGS service that will deliver a materially stronger, more resilient, flexible, and innovative sterling settlement system for the United Kingdom to respond to the rapidly changing payments landscape,” the bank says. “The renewed service will offer a diverse and flexible range of settlement models.” The Bank of England will publish a summary of its proof of concept findings later in 2018.",

First, we ran the ZenBook on its own for about 24 hours to establish a baseline, but pretty soon after that we realized our little pool was going to need more power if we wanted to come anywhere close to our goal of $1,000,000 in bitcoin, so we fired up of our laptops, bringing some serious horsepower to bear on the task. Doing that was as simple as installing the NiceHash software on each laptop and connecting them all to our NiceHash wallet.

Well, we made about nine cents a day with just one laptop, and with all of them running we made around forty cents a day, give or take, depending on the current price of Bitcoin. That means it would take us an excess of 6,800 years to become bitcoin millionaires from mining off just a couple .

    "detailContent": " With interest in cryptocurrency and crypto mining at an all time high, some were surprised that NVIDIA didn’t focus on that segment at its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC). The company has had a rocky relationship with crypto-miners, who have in recent years intensified demand for NVIDIA’s GPUs. While this is good for the bottom line, it also makes it  for gamers and other users. After noting that cryptocurrency mining represents only a small fraction of NVIDIA’s GPU business, CEO Jensen Huang distanced himself from the Bitcoin market, stating, “We’re not involved in Bitcoin at all. Bitcoin [mining] is done largely by ASICs today.” Unlike the GPU, which can handle a range of high-level computing power from deep learning to artificial intelligence, ASICs are efficient application-specific integrated circuit designed for a single task. It is estimated that cryptocurrency mining  of GPU sales last year, and that number is poised to grow this year. Where NVIDIA has a prominent role in the cryptocurrency market is . “What uses our GPU is Ethereum,” Huang said. “Ethereum ‘ether’ was designed as an algorithm to ensure that no singular entity or a few entities has the power to control the ether. It was designed so that the algorithm requires the type of computing capabilities — the type of processing capabilities — that are made possible by the use of GPUs in a distributed system.” Huang  of cryptocurrency at the company’s keynote earlier this week, despite that many gamers assume mining is to blame for the rising prices of GPUs. “The reason why the GPU is so popular with Ethereum is because the GPU is the single largest distributed supercomputer in the world,” he said. “It is the only supercomputer that is literally in everyone’s hands. And as a result, no single entity can control currency.” Ahead of the start of the  earlier this week, a Susquehanna market analyst raised some concerns that NVIDIA and rival AMD may encounter increased competition in the cryptocurrency mining market as Bitmain may soon release an ASIC that is capable of mining Ethereum. Huang appeared unfazed, however. While promoting the benefits of GPUs for the cryptocurrency market, he maintains that cryptocurrency mining is not NVIDIA’s business. Instead, GTC’s major focus is to leverage the power of the GPU in systems like the newly launched DGX-2, Tesla, Drive, and GV100s to make advancements in gaming, workstation, artificial intelligence, healthcare and cloud computing. “Quite frankly, I prefer that our GPUs are available to be used in those areas,” Huang stated, referring to AI and gaming. “And the reason is that there is so much shortage of GPUs at the moment. It’s hard for us to keep it in stock.”",

    "title": "Best Bitcoin Miner | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Where once  was something that you could conduct at home, with your consumer PC or maybe even a decently powerful graphics card (GPU), today Bitcoin mining is an industry unto itself. It needs cheap electricity, good airflow for cooling, and most importantly, powerful hardware. For Bitcoin mining, you need an ASIC miner. Where many altcoins are today mined using powerful GPU mining rigs — forcing up  —  is so competitive and difficult, that you need specific hardware for the job. Specifically, Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASIC miners. Although many of them use the same chips designed to do the job fast and efficiently, the power they draw and their cooling solutions can differ a lot. Getting rich quick with Bitcoin has largely passed, even for those willing to invest a lot, but with cheap electricity and the right hardware, you can at least get off on the right foot. The hands-down best Bitcoin mining rig in the world is the Bitmain Antminer S9. Although it has a sequel waiting somewhere in the wings, for now it offers the best performance per watt of any  rig out there. Bitmain has been at the forefront of ASIC miner development for some time now and the Antminer S9 is the most powerful piece of kit it has ever produced. Its hash power measures up at 13-14 TH per second, which is nearly three times that of its predecessor, the S7. It also only draws 1,300 watts of power, which is significantly less than some of the competitor ASIC miners out there, making it much more efficient than them too. Although there are some miners which claim to have a higher hash rate, or better power efficiency, nothing comes close to the Antminer S9 when it comes to the mix of the two. With a projected earnings of around , it holds great potential to earn a good amount for any new owners, though electricity cost is still a major component in that calculation. Make sure you don’t plan to run it in your bedroom either, as the S9 can get quite loud if it doesn’t have access to cool air. The only real downside with the Antminer S9 though, is getting hold of one at a reasonable price. Current stock on the Bitmain website is entirely sold out and buying from third-party resellers can see enormous inflation over the standard price. You could buy one second hand, but mining hardware can burn out very quickly, so you roll the dice when you don’t know what usage it has seen already.  Although less powerful and less efficient than the Antminer S9, the T9 is also a popular choice among miners because it is considered the more reliable of the two. It doesn’t push the ASIC chips as hard and features a longer warranty (180 days vs 90 days for the S9). For those wanting a more hands-off mining set up, T9’s offer greater reliability and potentially a more stable investment, at the cost of not as great a return on it. By the numbers, most T9s are available at around the 11.5 TH per second range, with a power draw of 1,450w.  that future batches may have a hashrate closer to 12.5 TH per second, though those units will draw as much as 1,576 watts to achieve it. As with the S9, getting a hold of a T9 is difficult. The Bitmain website doesn’t even list them on the store at the time of writing, so you will need to resort to Amazon or eBay to find yours. Prices are rather favorable compared to S9 listings, with some purportedly “new” units selling for around $2,000, while second hand units can be found for closer to $1,000.  Although less efficient and substantially less powerful than its newer counterparts, one alternative for Bitcoin miners with shallower pockets is the Antminer S7. With a hash rate around 4.7 TH per second and a power draw of 1,300 watts, you aren’t going to mine anywhere near as much as the T9 or S9, but they do tend to be substantially cheaper. Bitmain doesn’t sell the S7 any more, but it can be found on auction sites and some retailers for $1,000 new, or for a few hundred dollars second hand. That said, due to the reduced efficiency of this device, you will need very cheap electricity to avoid running at a loss. Anything north of $0.09 per kwh and you’re wasting your time. That might change if Bitcoin’s price goes up, but if and when that will happen is anyone’s guess.  Bitmain As much as Bitmain hardware is the most popular for Bitcoin mining, it’s not the only company producing it.  is a Chinese company that produces reasonably powerful and efficient mining rigs itself, but getting hold of one is rather difficult. If you want to purchase its latest Avalon 821 or 841 miners, you’ll need to buy them in batches of at least 20 — with a price tag of more than $35,000. Where their efficiency and power can rival the Antminer S9, their scarcity makes them hard to recommend. Instead, you are likely better off opting to buy an Avalon 741, which is easier to find, though far from as powerful or efficient. Available new on Amazon for around $1,600 or second hand on auction sites for around half of that, you’ll get a reliable 7TH per second for your money with a power draw of around 1,150 watts.  The chips that Pagolin Miner uses in its design are much larger than their contemporaries. Where the S9 and others use 16nm ASIC chips, the M3X has nearly 200 28nm chips and they show it through their power draw. The M3X requires anywhere between 1,800 watts and 2,000 watts of power, making it the most power hungry ASIC miner on this list. However, with a hash rate of between 12 and 13.5 TH per second, it’s also one of the most powerful. Crucially though, it’s also much more affordable. Where the running costs are going to be far higher with a unit like this than many of the others listed here, the M3X can cost you as little as $1,020 if you’re willing to wait until May for it to ship out to you. There’s also a batch that will ship out in early April for just a couple of hundred dollars more. Although cheap electricity is even more important with a device like the M3X due to its poor efficiency, the lower up-front cost means that you could, in theory, get a faster return on your investment under the right circumstances.  Now that you’ve picked your prospective mining rig, here’s a .",

Google insiders such as these said that many within the company believe that the tech giant’s line of cloud services are a natural fit for blockchain technology, though Google is not ready to make any official announcements just yet. However, a company spokesperson did confirm that Google was investigating the tech. “Like many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it’s way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,” a Google spokesperson told Bloomberg. The rise of blockchain technology provides both opportunities and challenges for industry leaders such as Google. On one hand, when properly leveraged, the tech could provide Google with a more secure way of storing user data, which could be a boon for the company and its customers alike. The downside is that the rise of this new technology has made it easier for startups to compete with Google or undermine its market leadership Google, like any powerful and established company, has one key tactic for dealing with startups and rivals: buying them out.

    "detailContent": " Atlanta mayor Keisha Bottoms said on Thursday, March 22, that hackers attacked the city’s network system and encrypted data. The details are somewhat slim for now, but hackers reportedly used the SamSam ransomware and demand around $51,000 in Bitcoin to unlock the city’s seized computers. Atlanta is currently working with the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, Microsoft, and Cisco cybersecurity officials to determine the scope of the damage and regain control of the data held hostage. “Our Atlanta Information Management team is working diligently with support from Microsoft to resolve the issue,” the city’s . “We are confident that our team of technology professionals will be able to restore applications soon. Our city website, , remains accessible and we will provide updates as we receive them.” As of Thursday afternoon, the city said it faced outages on various “internal and customer facing applications,” such as means for accessing court-related information and paying bills. But the city itself isn’t exactly under siege: Airport, public safety, and water operations remain unaffected by the attack, and the city payroll wasn’t touched. The only bone Atlanta is throwing the public is that the attack affects “various city systems.” According to Atlanta’s newly appointed chief operating officer, Richard Cox, Atlanta Information Management officials were made aware of problems with internal and customer-facing applications at 5:40 a.m. Thursday. At the time, he acknowledged that the city fell prey to ransomware, but given the investigation is still ongoing, he couldn’t provide the extent of the damage.  “The ongoing investigation will determine whether personal information, financial, or employee data has been compromised,” he said during a press briefing. “As a precaution, we are asking that all employees take the appropriate measures to ensure their data is not compromised. The city advises employees to monitor and protect personal information and in the coming days we will offer employees additional resources if needed.” What the city didn’t officially disclose was  in the investigation. A screenshot reveals the hackers’ demands: 0.8 Bitcoins for each seized computer, or six bitcoins to unlock all computers held hostage, equaling to around $51,000 in real cash. Once Atlanta sends the Bitcoins to a digital wallet, the city is to leave a message containing the host name on a specific website. The hackers will then provide decryption software to release the computers from captivity. The SamSam malware doesn’t take the typical route of installing itself on computers when unsuspecting owners click a link within an email. Instead, hackers find unpatched vulnerabilities in network servers and manually unleash SamSam to seize key data systems and cause maximum damage to the company’s infrastructure. SamSam is one of many in a family of ransomware . It was first observed in 2015 and  using the Advanced Encryption Standard (aka Rijndael). It then encrypts that key with RSA 2048-bit encryption to make the files utterly unrecoverable. As of Friday morning, Atlanta’s main website and its affiliated portals remained unaffected by the ransomware attack.",

    "detailContent": " Researchers at RWTH Aachen University in Germany  the entire Bitcoin blockchain and discovered it contains links to child pornography websites and a possible image of a “mildly nude” minor. They were investigating the blockchain’s non-financial data to uncover “objectionable” content but stumbled across the appalling surprise. The researchers provided their findings in  during the  conference in late February. At the time of the download,  weighed at a hefty 122GB in size. The researchers concluded that only 1.4 percent of all blockchain transactions contain non-financial data, which consumes a mere 118.5MB of the entire blockchain volume. Even more, the transactions with data they could actually read weighed a mere 22.6MB. This is where they stumbled across the child pornography. A blockchain typically records transactions using Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. It’s a decentralized ledger that keeps track of anonymous purchases between buyer and seller. It’s secure because the technology is based on cryptography, thus data can’t be modified or traced back to a specific individual. But users can inject the blockchain with non-financial data by encoding that data as a standard transaction. Currently, there are four services that can inject non-financial data into the blockchain: CryptoGraffiti, Satoshi Uploaded, P2SH Injectors, and Apertus. After their investigation, the researchers unearthed 274 links to child pornography sites. But the problem goes beyond child pornography: The blockchain can also be used to store pirated copyrighted content, malware, stolen personal data and/or images, leaked government information, and other “illegal and condemned” content. The real kicker is how a blockchain works: Because it is decentralized, it relies on a network of millions of PCs scattered across the globe rather than one specific bank or government institution.  Thus, given that anyone can inject the blockchain with non-financial data, controversial and possibly illegal content can be problematic for everyone maintaining the blockchain. “Since all blockchain data is downloaded and persistently stored by users, they are liable for any objectionable content added to the blockchain by others. Consequently, it would be illegal to participate in a blockchain-based system as soon as it contains illegal content,” the paper states. Because of a blockchain’s anonymous nature, countries will need to add this technology to their list of platforms that can’t post illegal content, such as filesharing networks, newsgroups, online storage, social networks, and so on. More specifically, they need to deem blockchain data illegal that can be converted to “visual representation of illegal content” by anyone with access to the blockchain.”A plethora of fundamentally different methods to store non-financial–potentially objectionable–content on the blockchain exists in Bitcoin. As of now, this can affect at least 112 countries in which possessing content such as child pornography is illegal. This especially endangers the multi-billion-dollar markets powering cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,” the paper adds. Unfortunately, due to the cryptographic nature of the blockchain, methods to remove illegal content is unknown at the moment.",

The ban comes after Maduro created the cryptocurrency in an effort to stem the tide of rapidly rising inflation. , the inflation rate will likely hit 13,000 percent by the end of 2018. The destabilized economy has created a humanitarian disaster and the oil-backed cryptocurrency reportedly hasn’t helped matters — despite Maduro’s claims to the contrary. “President Maduro decimated the Venezuelan economy and spurred a humanitarian crisis. Instead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency — a ploy that Venezuela’s democratically elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned U.S. persons to avoid,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said. Whether or not this will actually have an effect on cryptocurrency markets remains to be seen. Maduro claimed to have sold around $5 billion in Petro cryptocurrency, but it’s unclear if that is actually true, or if it was a statement made to drive up interest. “Since most cryptocurrencies are not actually backed by anything real, cryptocurrency speculation is based on the greater fool theory — I can buy this at $100 because there is someone who is a bigger idiot who is going to buy it at $200. When you take the U.S. out of that equation, you reduce the interest and potential for that speculation,” Russ Dallen of Caracas Capital told . What does this all mean for you? Well, as long as you don’t have any of Venezuela’s Petro in your portfolio, you don’t have anything to worry about. If you do, you might be stuck with it, because this executive order makes it very clear that any transaction involving Petro — even selling it as a result of this ban — is currently prohibited for U.S. citizens.",

    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrency is having a tough time lately, with extreme volatility in its value and issues around fraud and abuse in cryptocurrency exchanges given it a bad name and causing governments and private organizations to take steps to limit its impact. Regarding the latter, both Facebook and Google are banning cryptocurrency advertising on their ad networks and now another social media giant, Twitter, is thinking of following suit. The report comes via , and according to the outlet, Twitter will start banning advertisements for initial coin offerings (ICOs), cryptocurrency wallets, and token sales sometime within the next two weeks. Also under consideration is a ban on cryptocurrency exchange advertisements, although apparently, Twitter might consider some exceptions in this category. While Twitter’s overall share of the online advertising market is low, its decision to limit cryptocurrency advertising is a very visible action given its importance in the social media sphere. The reasons given for these bans are varied, but they mostly involve deceptive or misleading activities that lead to trader losses. Regarding its own ban, , “Two of our core advertising principles outline our belief that ads should be safe, and that we build for people first. Misleading or deceptive ads have no place on .” For now, Facebook’s ban is very broad, and it covers all of its platforms including  itself, Audience Network, and Instagram. , on the other hand, is aiming its own efforts on “unregulated or speculative financial products,” of which cryptocurrency is just one element. The search giant removed more than 3.2 billion ads in 2017 generated by roughly 320,000 ad publishers. Cryptocurrency ads are being categorized as “emerging threats” and Google’s concerns with them mostly involve the unregulated nature of cryptocurrency markets. Google’s ban will go into effect in June across its AdWords network. With many government agencies looking to regulate and limit cryptocurrencies and the markets springing up around them, the future of the exchange medium remains uncertain. Twitter’s move is just one more in a long line of efforts to limit their impact and to minimize the damage to unprepared traders based on deceptive promotional activities.",

    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrencies, especially , saw a major surge in value and popularity last year. Unfortunately, this also means that scams and ponzi schemes became more prevalent. In response to this, the Federal Trade Commission has stepped into the fray. The FTC has issued restraining orders and frozen the assets of three defendants who were part of the Bitcoin Funding Team and My7Network. The  alleges that the three defendants “promised big rewards for a small payment of Bitcoin or Litecoin.” According to the report, the organization functioned like any other ponzi scheme. The only way participants could make money was by recruiting new members, who would in turn pay in cryptocurrency. Participants in the program were required to pay both an earlier participant and the Bitcoin Funding Team. After paying these fees, users would then be allowed to recruit new members, would pay them in turn. The organization also told members that they would be eligible for additional rewards if they paid a higher amount. In addition to Bitcoin Funding Team, one of the defendants, Scott Chandler, pitched an additional service called Jet-Coin. This platform featured a similar recruitment model to the Bitcoin Funding Team, and promised that users would receive a fixed return on their investment as a result of Bitcoin trading. In a series of promotional calls, Chandler promised that users could double their investments within 50 days. One victim of Chandler’s scheme said that she joined Gladiacoin when they agreed to pay her 2.2 percent per day if she purchased Bitcoin packages. Chandler then moved on to Jet-Coin, which eventually shut down, leaving her $400 poorer. It’s worth noting that the FTC would have targeted the Bitcoin Funding Team regardless of what currency was used, as the underlying ponzi scheme remains the same. “This case shows that scammers always find new ways to market old schemes, which is why the FTC will remain vigilant regardless of the platform – or currency used,” Tom Pahl, Acting Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection told . “The schemes the defendants promoted were designed to enrich those at the top at the expense of everyone else.”",

    "title": "Cryptocurrency Miners Now Charged Higher Power Fees in New York | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " The New York State Public Service Commission  that upstate municipal power providers are now allowed to charge higher rates to cryptocurrency miners. The reason should be obvious: Companies and individuals  are consuming large amounts of power, which takes a toll on local power companies distributing electricity to residential homes and businesses. Thus, instead of raising everyone’s rates to fight the surge, companies can now single out miners. The New York Municipal Power Agency previously urged the Commission to crack down on “high-load” customers. The Agency serves as a voice for 36 municipal power companies across New York, some of which provide low-cost power via hydropower plants to customers without making a profit. It’s through these hydro-based channels where the impact is felt the most because miners are taking advantage of the low-cost energy. According to the commission, companies and individuals mining for digital coins are using “thousands of times” more electricity than the average customer. This may go unnoticed in large metropolitan areas, but small communities now face higher monthly payments because power companies need more funds to keep all customers illuminated while also compensating for the miners. “Cryptocurrency companies generally seek to occupy existing commercial or industrial facilities where they can gain access to the large amounts of power required for their operations,” the Commission states. “As some of these customers have come online, it has become clear that the type of electricity load demand was of a different character than load characteristics typically seen by NYMPA members.” Cryptocurrency miners, at least the large ones, can’t depend on a single PC. Instead, they build monstrosities with numerous  stringed to one machine. These machines consume large amounts of power to create digital money and maintain the currency’s platform. Throw numerous mining machines into a building and you have a cryptocurrency mining farm gobbling power each second. The commission notes that a single cryptocurrency mining “customer” can consume 33 percent of the local power company’s total load. Meanwhile, the agency    “A new tariff focusing on high-density load customers that do not qualify for economic development assistance and have a maximum demand exceeding 300 kW and a load density that exceeds 250 kWh per square foot per year, a usage amount far higher than traditional commercial customers,” the commission explains. The price increase for these customers began this month while costs for everyone else will return to normal.",

    "title": "Big Fish in the Crypto-Pond – Who Owns All the Bitcoin? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Even if you’re sitting on what you consider a sizable number of Bitcoin, or a Litecoin horde that would make you rich if you sold it all, you’re almost certainly not as big a fish as you might think. Neither are most of the millions of other wallet owners. The majority of the world’s digital currency is owned by just a few thousand wallets. Though the owners are anonymous, they are absolutely, stinking rich. Few would have predicted in early 2017 that, by the tail end of the year, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would . Many jumped on the bandwagon late and found themselves floundering as prices crashed down. The problem was so severe that banks stepped in to curtail Bitcoin purchases. The recent correction didn’t shake the biggest owners of cryptocurrency, however. A few crypto-whales are sitting on a stash of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash worth billions of dollars, and they’re not selling. Instead, most of them continue to buy, hoarding masses of cryptocurrency, gradually migrating Bitcoin and altcoins into the hands of the crypto elite. According to statistics put together by  through parsing the blockchain, of roughly 23 million Bitcoin wallets in existence, more than 13 million of them own only a fraction of a Bitcoin. While many in number, they make up a minuscule portion of the overall financial landscape. At the other end of the scale, only 1,500 addresses have between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins in them. The top 111 wallets have more than 10,000 Bitcoins a piece. That’s tens of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency in each wallet. The 100 largest Bitcoin wallets are together worth $28.6 billion. Using BitInfoChart’s latest calculations, 87 percent of all Bitcoins ever mined are owned by just half a percent of Bitcoin wallets. The figures only tighten from there. 61 percent of all Bitcoins are owned by just 0.07 percent of wallets. That’s an incredible amount of wealth in the hands of very, very few. The  contains 163,133 Bitcoins, worth around $1.6 billion. It’s thought to be a cold storage wallet — a Bitcoin wallet kept offline to avoid hacking – owned by BitFenix, a cryptocurrency exchange. That may be the case for many of the largest wallets; the frequency of payments in and out give a hint to such an identity. Whoever owns them, they are sitting on vast fortunes. There are over 100 Bitcoin wallets around the world with a collective $28.6 billion worth of Bitcoin in them, and that’s with a price half that of the December 2017 peak. Tantalizingly, there’s many wallets in the top-100 richest that haven’t been touched in a long time. Some of those, like the  in the world – worth around $657 million — have never taken any Bitcoin out, and haven’t had a meaningful input since 2014. These are classed as . They could be true long term holders who want to see where the market goes, or part of the  to wiped hard drives, forgotten passwords, and other problems. Many large wallets are active, however, and the largest Bitcoin wallets are getting larger. The  increased its holdings by 60,000 Bitcoins in the last days of 2017. While it’s transferred out a few thousand since, it seems clear that it was taking advantage of the big dip that hit Bitcoin pricing following its latest surge. The  followed a similar pattern in early 2018. The spread of wealth among the whales of other cryptocurrencies is much the same and, if anything, the largest altcoin wallets are even less keen on trading out their currency than the key Bitcoin owners. In the , 70 addresses — less than .001 percent of all Litecoin wallet addresses in existence — own more than 23 million Litecoin. That’s 42 percent of all holdings. Just 0.15 percent of Litecoin wallets – around 3,200 of them – control more than 70 percent of the total. The top 30 percent of Litecoin wallets control 99.62 percent of all Litecoin in existence. While an argument can be made that some the top Bitcoin wallets with lots of ins and outs are owned by exchanges due to their frequency of transactions, the infrequency of Litecoin wallet transfers suggest they are more likely owned by wealthy investors. Of the top 10 wallets, only one has ever moved Litecoin out. That wallet first purchased Litecoin in 2014 and has  of Litecoin in the following years. The hoarding of wealth by a slim number of wallets gives those owners incredible power. Like stock traders, if the largest Bitcoin wallet owners decided to cash out, it could send prices tanking, leaving the much smaller investors concerned about what to do with the rapidly dwindling value of their own holdings. If the largest Bitcoin wallet owners decided to cash out, it could send prices tanking. The whales don’t even need to sell to raise concerns. In November of 2017, Bitcoin investor  by moving tens of thousands of Bitcoin to various exchanges. His  also , and alongside the transaction cost issue Bitcoin faced at the time, may have been part of the reason that Bitcoin values crashed hard in December. As Edgar Bers of  told Digital Trends in a recent interview, it’s possible that large cryptocurrency owners might ‘shake the trees’ of nervous investors by deliberately downing cryptocurrency values through large sales, or public statements of low confidence, only to increase their holdings when prices decrease. It’s almost impossible prove that’s the case given the psyeduanonymous nature of cryptocurrency wallets. Still, we know the biggest wallets are buying more at perceived lows, and few of the top wallets are selling much, if any, of their holdings. It’s also possible the biggest wallet owners communicate with one another –  – which could make the strategy of shorting cryptocurrencies, even through , far more viable. This may seem depressing for those looking to make a small profit from their cryptocurrency investments, but there’s a silver lining. This distribution of wealth shows big money is interested in cryptocurrency. Given the amounts invested, it seems certain that billionaires have invested in its future, and they see it as bright enough that they’re willing to not only continue to hold on to their existing wallet holdings during big downturns like the one at the end of 2017, but even use the downturn as an opportunity to buy more. Many people look to financial advisers and talking heads for investment advice, but perhaps the best bet with cryptocurrencies is to keep an eye on the biggest wallets in the world. The crypto-whales seem to be able to track and predict (or at worst, influence) the biggest downturns, often using them to increase their holdings. Cryptocurrency’s future is not certain but, for now, the commitment of big investors at least offers a bare measure of stability. Whatever happens, cryptocurrencies will remain relevant as long as the whales don’t abandon them.",

    "detailContent": " The Plattsburgh, New York city council voted unanimously to introduce an 18-month ban on commercial Bitcoin mining operations within the city. The move comes after city residents complained of wildly inflated electricity bills caused by commercial  operations taking advantage of the city’s low-cost power. As , the moratorium is aimed at new commercial Bitcoin-mining operations, so businesses already operating cryptocurrency mines in Plattsburgh will be able to continue doing business. It’s a stopgap designed to keep power bills for ordinary residents from continuing to grow. “I’ve been hearing a lot of complaints that electric bills have gone up by $100 or $200,” Plattsburgh mayor Colin Read told Motherboard. The moratorium is only for 18 months and it remains to be seen what will happen once it expires, but local Bitcoin-mining operations are watching these developments carefully. Some even agree that commercial operations should be charged more for using up the city’s cheap, plentiful hydroelectric power. “I think it’s better to charge the miners more so that people in the city aren’t negatively impacted, than an outright ban. But still reasonably so, or companies won’t want to set up shop here,” said Dan Bowman, a bitcoin entrepreneur, . “I think middle ground should be sought so peoples electric rates don’t go up.” The main thing that has drawn so many Bitcoin-mining operations to Plattsburgh has been the city’s proximity to a hydroelectric power plant. It’s the reason the city has some of the lowest power costs in the U.S. But those low prices only go so far. The city has an allotment of 104 megawatt-hours of electricity per month, and if it consumes more than that, the city has to buy power on the open market, at much higher rates. That is why notoriously power-hungry Bitcoin operations have inadvertently caused ordinary citizens’ power bills to skyrocket. The largest mining operation in the city, Coinmint, reportedly used nearly 10 percent of the city’s power budget in January and February. To compensate without scaring off Bitcoin operations, Read suggested a number of potential solutions, including charging local commercial Bitcoin operations for any overages the cause the city to incur. Regardless of how the city ends up deciding to handle the problem of commercial Bitcoin operations sucking up power, looks like it has 18 months to do it.",

However, according to one mining rig builder we spoke to, that may only be hurting gamers, and helping companies that buy GPUs in bulk. Certainly, it doesn’t seem that limiting sales has had effect on prices. A look at the big retail websites reveals  selling for double, or more, their launch price. Current-generation GPUs are . Unfortunately, the limitations companies are putting on  sales have no impact on those buying the most graphics cards — the big mining rig manufacturers. Digital Trends spoke to the founder of the largest mining rig builder in the UK at the recent He said that, if anything, the limitations help his business. “We haven’t [been impacted by limitations] because commercially we’re at a different scale,” explained  founder, Josh Riddett. “It’s probably been a benefit for us if anything, because it’s probably a barrier for entry for someone trying to do it themselves.” He went on to explain that some of his customers come to Easy Crypto Hunter after trying, and failing, to acquire GPUs for their own home-built mining rig. “We have a lot of people say ‘I’ve been thinking of building a rig, I’m stuck, I can only get three [GPUs],\u0027” he said. “You can come to me, you can buy 10 rigs […] and you mine from the next day.” Riddett’s company had more than 10 mining rigs for sale at the show (each with six   cards) and promised a 10-14 day turnaround for new buyers once those were sold out. His company is also selling mining “farms” for landlords to replace tenants, and has a still-in-development concept of a shipping container that comes outfitted with 280+ GTX 1080Ti cards. Although he did admit it wasn’t easy to get the numbers of graphics cards his business requires — and an employee at Easy Crypto Hunter told us that shipping containers may take a few weeks to fill — it was possible. “We spend a lot of money with the right people to get the stuff and obviously it’s as difficult for us as it is for other people,” he said. “We’ve reached a scale now [though] where we get a lot of preferential treatment, and ultimately it’s a case of getting that hardware out to people and doing it as quick as we can. So even now in the midst of the shortage, we’re the only company to keep units on stock.” If companies such as Easy Crypto Hunter have no real difficulty in purchasing tens, or potentially even hundreds of some of the most powerful, and therefore limited, cards in the world, what hope do average gamers have? It could be the case that sales limits to one card per customer even hurt those trying to build high-end, multi-GPU . Perhaps they should do what Riddett told us elsewhere in the interview.

    "detailContent": " At a recent cryptocurrency investor show, one mining rig builder told Digital Trends he thinks the best way for gamers to offset the  is to mine cryptocurrency in their spare time. By his reckoning, most cards can pay for themselves in just over a year. Although the  may be months behind us at this point, the mining boom that was born off of the back of it shows no sign of abating. In turn,  prices remain ridiculously inflated. Even obsolete cards are selling for more than double their launch prices, as availability plagues gamers and miners alike. While miners look to make a profit on their expensive investment, gamers just want to have fun. That’s not the tack they should be taking according to ‘s founder and Managing Director, Josh Riddett. During a sit down with Digital Trends at the London , he suggested gamers should be mining, too. “I totally feel for them, I get it. I am an avid gamer myself,” he said when asked how he felt about the impact businesses like his were having on graphics card pricing and gamer upgrade limitations. “I’ve spent a lot of my life gaming, I love it. I’ve made a lot of great friends in the online world. The reality of it is [though], no one rides horses when they’ve got cars,” he said. “Sometimes you’ve got to move with the times. At the end of the day, I appreciate that a graphics card will now cost you twice what it did before, I get that and it sucks, but it can also pay for itself in a year. So it’s kind of swings and roundabouts. It’s very easy to leave your computer mining overnight when you’re not using it, and effectively the  will pay for itself.” Riddet’s four-month-old business does deal exclusively in GTX 1080Ti graphics cards, and purchases in bulk from both distributors and manufacturers. That’s not a card that many gamers would have been buying, in any case, because of its high MSRP. However, there is a trickle-down element to that. If other miners and gamers can’t buy those cards, they’ll buy the next ones down the list, and the mid-range has already been decimated by miners building more energy-efficient rigs. If gamers were willing to mine, however,  Riddet thinks they’d easily offset the cost of the card. “[Graphics cards] are harder to get [and] three years ago the prices were cheaper,” he admitted, “but three years ago the card couldn’t pay for itself. Now it can. It’s more money up front, but I’d argue less money out of your pocket in the long run.” Riddet’s take seems a bit self-serving, but also offers some insight into the world of cryptocurrency hardware. His perspective makes it clear the companies building crypto-mining rigs still enjoy more than enough profit, despite the fact Bitcoin’s price is at roughly half its peak value. Gamers may not like his advice — after all, most don’t  to hassle with mining a cryptocurrency. If AMD and Nvidia can’t find a way to build and distribute cards at more reasonable prices, though, gamers may not have a choice.",

Buy tokens at a 15-percent discount NOW!” and “Click here to learn more about our no-risk cryptocurrency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world.” “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception,”  states. “That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.” Google said on Wednesday, March 14, that not only did the company ban 320,000 publishers from its advertisement network in 2017 but it blacklisted nearly 90,000 websites and 700,000 mobile apps. Google also removed legitimate ads from two million individual pages each month that violated its policies. Google tacked on another 8,700 pages after updating its policies in April 2017 to protect web surfers against “dangerous and derogatory content.” Subscription-free websites generate revenue by displaying advertisements stemming from platforms like Google’s AdWords. But for a free, ad-supported internet to work, those ads need to be safe and effective. For Google, that means investing in talent and technology over the last 15 years to crack down on ad-based fraud, scammers, and malware. Banning cryptocurrency ads is just the latest step in that direction.",

    "title": "Leak Shows Inno3D Launching Mining Card Based on GTX 1080 Ti | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Recent rumors suggest Nvidia will soon release dedicated cryptocurrency cards codenamed “Turing.” The cards would presumably be based on a modified version of the , Nvidia’s latest graphics chip designs — but a new leak suggests that the upcoming mining cards may use  from the company’s GTX 1080 TI and Titan-branded cards. The leak stems from an upcoming Inno3D card packing the P102-100 graphics chip, but no bracket for attaching it to a mining frame, or video output. It also appears to use Inno3D’s Twin X2 cooler design sporting two fans and five heatpipes. Here are the specifications compared to the GTX 1080 Ti card:   3,200 3,584 1,582MHz 1,480MHz N/A 1,582MHz 5GB GDDR5X 11GB GDDR5X 11Gbps 11Gbps 320-bit 352-bit 400GB/s 484GB/s 250 watts 250 watts 2× 8-pin 1× 6-pin, 1× 8-pin PCI Express Gen1 ×4 PCI Express Gen3 ×16 Dual slot\n\n8.46 × 4.92 inches Dual slot\n\n10.5 × 4.376 inches As the specifications show, Inno3D’s model for miners is a cutdown version of the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti  for PC gamers. It has a lower core count, less on-board memory, a smaller interface width, and a smaller memory bandwidth. Additionally, the specifications show the card may simply run at 1,582MHz rather than fluctuate between two speeds as seen with the GTX 1080 Ti. Now here are the hash rates supposedly proposed by Inno3D: ~660 Sol/s ~879 H/s Nvidia quietly introduced two graphics chips dedicated to cryptocurrency mining last summer: The P106-100 and the P104-100. Cards based on these two chips weren’t released by Nvidia, but rather third-party manufacturers including Asus, Colorful, EVGA, Galaxy, Inno3D, MSI, and Zotac. Both are based on Nvidia’s previous-generation “Pascal” design, and the new leaked Inno3D card could serve as a high-end Pascal-based product that will be cheaper than Nvidia’s rumored “Turing” cards for miners arriving this year. As a reference, Nvidia provides the GP106 chip in its GTX 1060 graphics cards for PC gamers while the GP104 serves as the source in its GTX 1070, GTX 1070 Ti, and GTX 1080 cards. Meanwhile, the GP102 can be seen in the Titan Xp, Titan X, and GTX 1080 Ti high-end . Previous rumors indicated that Nvidia would discontinue its Pascal-based graphics chips, but the Inno3D leak reveals Nvidia still has plans for its previous-generation GPU family. Exactly when Nvidia will reveal its new generation of graphics chips is . “Volta” is its current GPU design seen in  for desktop gamers costing $2,999 along with the  card for data centers. Following these cards will be the GeForce GTX 20 Series for gamers dubbed as “Ampere,” and cryptocurrency mining cards dubbed as “Turing.” But given the new Inno3D leak, whether Turing will depend on Pascal or Volta remains to be seen.",

    "title": "Fake Startup Uses Initial Coin Offering to Steal Over $2 Million in Coins | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " An individual or group recently  to scam a little over $2 million from more than 1,000 investors sinking funds into a fake initial coin offering (ICO). The offering supposedly helped fund a startup called Giza Device Ltd. that was developing a device to store cryptocurrencies. The ICO took place in January, and by the beginning of February, the company held more than 2,100  provided by ICO investors. Now Giza is offline and the digital coins are gone. Investors immediately became suspicious when the company assigned to manufacture the cryptocurrency device, Russian firm Third Pin LLC,  that it halted manufacturing because of non-payment. Giza Chief Operating Officer Marco Fike told Third Pin that it needed to establish new operations outside Russia but didn’t provide an explanation or information. Without the funds,  “Recently we started negotiations with cryptographic integral chips manufacturer, but, due to the position of Giza’s COO, we couldn’t even acquire critical technical documentation to start the development,” Third Pin LLC’s CEO “Ivan” said. “With a heavy heart, I am forced to tell that we are freeze all the activities related to the Giza device project.” What is strange about Fike is that no one has actually seen this individual, not even developers, contractors, investors, and former employees. The only evidence of his “existence” is  listing alleged fake jobs, including a community manager position denied by Microsoft. The University of Oxford is still investigating the listed Master’s degree in International Business. Even more, the profile picture links back to an Instagram account that never responded to inquiries. Suspicious, investors of the ICO began asking questions through a  channel managed by an individual named Karina. Originally, Fike hired Karina through Freelancehunt.com and only communicated with her through Telegram and Skype chats. Communications with Fike halted  as did her paychecks from Giza. But she was just one of many individuals short-changed by the startup. Giza’s website disappeared last Friday, but  describes the startup as “a group of young and ambitious programmers, hardware developers, industrial designers and marketers.” The proposed device included a cryptocurrency wallet, password manager, a file manager, and a two-factor authentication component. Early participants — those that invested in the ICO — were promised up to a 30 percent bonus. But the money is gone, drained over a period of two weeks. Although users of cryptocurrencies remain anonymous, the digital coins can still be traced, and that’s exactly what investors did in hopes of retrieving their stolen funds. There are three wallets associated with Giga outside the company’s main wallet where it originally stored the digital funds. Unfortunately, the flow of money moved through wallet No. 1 and wallet No. 2 until ending at the . Meanwhile, wallet No. 3 is linked to  in early February. During Bee Token’s official ICO, hopeful investors fell prey to an email scam that urged them to send Ethereum to hacker-controlled wallets before missing out on the offer.",

By harnessing the massive amounts of heat GPUs generate while mining cryptocurrency,  will not only keep you toasty during the winter months, it could very well earn you a little extra cash. “The heat of your QC-1 is generated by the two  embedded in the device and mining cryptocurrencies or blockchain transactions: While heating, you create money,” the QC1 product description reads. “You can watch in real time how crypto markets are trending, on your mobile app and on your QC-1 LEDs.” Really though, the QC1 heater is a slick-looking device, and it packs some serious power — two AMD Radeon RX 580s — but it retails for $3,600. That is a huge amount of money for what amounts to a space heater, even if it can mine cryptocurrency. Keep mind, that is all it can do, it doesn’t include a hard drive or an operating system. You control it from your phone. It can’t run games, it can’t be used to check your email. For that price, you could just buy  with two comparable cards inside and set them up for cryptocurrency mining yourself. Let’s do a little math. You would have to run the QC1 all day every day for five and a half years before it paid for itself, at the most recent Ethereum exchange rate. The real story here isn’t the QC1, it’s the fact that it exists at all. Using excess heat from cryptocurrency mining to heat your home is actually a really great idea. Mining cryptocurrency generates a tremendous amount of heat and putting it to good use could make passively mining cryptocurrency more approachable. Nobody is going to buy one of these things and strike it rich, that part of the cryptocurrency boom is probably over, but as a proof of concept, the QC 1 is a fascinating product. Waste heat has always been a huge issue for server farms, and even offices that run a lot of desktop computers, putting it to use in the home isn’t a bad idea. But at $3,600, it’s not a good one either.",

    "title": "These Online Bitcoin Courses Can Help You Master Cryptocurrency | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Almost everyone has heard of Bitcoin by now, especially given its surprising (although short-lived) move past $20,000 late last year. That growth garnered headlines across the globe and sent many people scrambling to buy up some of . Many of these amateur investors probably ended up disappointed – as of today, Bitcoin is hovering around $9,000 to $10,000 – but this is still impressive given that a single Bitcoin cost only a few cents in 2010. Ironically, this volatility makes Bitcoin more attractive to many investors (not to mention the potential of , which is fascinating by itself). Before you jump in, however, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the particulars of Bitcoin; although many standard investing fundamentals apply,  than stocks. We’ve rounded up a number of online Bitcoin courses from Udemy and the DT Shop – including a couple that  – to help you get started. Made by veteran members of the Bitcoin community, this beginner’s course covers all the basics of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Eight hours of material will teach you everything you need to know to get started, from the nature of the Bitcoin economy to how cryptocurrency is actually used in real transactions. It’s also completely newbie-friendly and aimed at people who have no computer expertise or prior experience with Bitcoin. Best of all, this course is totally free from Udemy; if you learn a bit about Bitcoin and decide it’s not really your bag, then you’re not on the hook for a single cent.  Once you’ve got the Bitcoin basics down, it’s time to learn the fundamentals of investing in cryptocurrencies. This course will teach you all about the tools you need to get started, from wallets to online exchanges, as well as different research methods, risk-management techniques, trading strategies, and more. This basic, beginner-friendly course is also free, so you can get started building your Bitcoin investor’s toolbox without having to spend anything.  After you’ve studied the basics of cryptocurrency, you’ll want to move into more advanced territory to fully master the skills necessary for successful investing. This online Bitcoin course will help you pass the Certified Bitcoin Professional exam, which, along with giving you advanced knowledge, will grant you a certification that is recognized throughout the huge (and growing) cryptocurrency community – a great thing to have whether you plan to become a successful investor, an entrepreneur, or even a Bitcoin educator yourself. The course includes three hours of educational material, as well as 75 practice questions, to get you ready for the exam. Like all of the paid Udemy courses in our roundup, this lesson is also on sale for just $12 right now, saving you $88.  Bitcoin is the big dog in the cryptocurrency pack, but it’s not the only one out there. Bitcoin’s success, popularity, and technological novelty has led to the creation of other cryptocurrencies, colloquially referred to as “altcoins” (i.e. Bitcoin alternatives), that are popular investment vehicles for tech-savvy traders. Just as with stocks, a successful crypto investor should have a diverse portfolio, so it’s a good idea to learn about different altcoins and how to implement them into your investment strategy. This $12 course will teach you a bit about popular altcoins like Ethereum and Ripple, how to get started with them, and how to incorporate these, along with Bitcoin, into your own portfolio in accordance with your personal goals and risk tolerance.  Computers and the internet haven’t only given normal people easier ways to invest, these technologies have also given rise to new tools and strategies to help us do research, implement trading strategies, and mitigate risk. One way to do this is through trading algorithms, which you set up to automatically execute transactions within defined parameters (such as stop/loss orders, in which a holding will be immediately sold if it dips below a certain price). For only $12, this lesson will teach you how to use a “robot” to create a semiautomated algorithmic Bitcoin trading system that will help you analyze trends, cut your losses, and free you from having to babysit your portfolio constantly.  You probably don’t see cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment given their general volatility compared to stocks and mutual funds, but can these digital coins be a viable addition to your retirement fund? You might be surprised – or maybe you won’t be, considering how much Bitcoin has grown in value over the past seven years. You won’t see an index fund do that. New altcoins are popping up quite frequently now, and this $12 Udemy course will show you how to spot promising up-and-comers, get your foot in the door early, and maintain the right mind-set for holding your position to reap long-term gains (without panic- selling and eating your losses). The instructor, a seasoned crypto veteran, also shares his current favorite long-term investment opportunity.  If you’re more of a one-stop shopper (and you love to save money, which of course you do), then we have some great online Bitcoin course package deals going right now. The Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Mastery Bundle runs the gamut, starting with the basics of Bitcoin before moving onto more advanced crypto trading and investment strategies. By the time you’re done with the first five lessons, you’ll be more than ready to tackle the sixth: the Bitcoin professional certification exam course. This six-lesson bundle, available on the DT Shop, gives you more than 22 hours of content and will only set you back $29.  Our second package of online Bitcoin courses is more focused on Bitcoin trading and even features a lesson on Ethereum, another extremely popular altcoin that has come onto the scene lately. You’ll study the fundamentals of crypto investing, master different trading platforms, learn how to read and navigate the markets, gain a deep understanding of blockchain technology, and learn how to use Ethereum and Steemit (a crypto-focused social media platform) to turn a tidy profit. This five-lesson, nine-hour bundle is the one to buy if you’re serious about getting into the crypto trading scene, and comes in at just $24 from the DT Shop.  Looking for more cool stuff?

    "detailContent": " Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and product director David Gasca indicated during  that the company wants all users to sport . Their intent arrives as scammers take to the social platform to steal money from unsuspecting victims through accounts created using a flaw in the verification system. Twitter users believe these accounts are “official” and backed by Twitter, handing over small amounts of digital currency to scammers for a promise of a big return, but remain empty-handed. “The main problem is we use it to mean identity, but because of the way it was originally started, where it was only given to certain very large public figures, celebrities, etcetera, it came to have a lot of status associated with it, as well,” . “They think of it as credibility. Twitter stands behind this person, Twitter believes that this person is someone that — what they’re saying is great and authentic, which is not at all what we mean by the checkmark.” That is why victims fall prey to the cryptocurrency scams proliferating across Twitter: Many accounts appear to be verified and backed by Twitter, which they are not.

Twitter performed the verification in-house, assigning the coveted checkmark to actors, musicians, and so on.

    "title": "(in)Secure: Cryptojacking is set to become the new malware epidemic | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  Cryptocurrency has fought for its reputation ever since its creation. Bitcoin fans have always had to defend against accusations that it’s only purpose is for illicit activities — that it’s a currency for criminals. Bill Gates even argued it has  in his recent Reddit AMA. Now, cryptocurrency has yet another problem to deal with: cryptojacking. It’s the act of hacking a computer for use in cryptocurrency mining, usually without the owner knowing about it. It’s the newest evolution of malware — and it looks set to spread like wildfire. In February,  a new crowdfunding campaign that caught headlines across the internet. You can donate your computing power through cloud mining to help support the publication. It doesn’t require the installation of software, or even setting up an account. Just like that, an alternative to paid subscriptions and ad-based revenue has appeared. Cloud mining was , and now it’s finding new, interesting use cases. Also in February,  his findings on the dark side of the technology. Without getting consent from either the owner of the website or visitors, cryptocurrency scripts can be hacked into websites, which then hack visitor’s CPU power. That’s cryptojacking. The past year has witnessed several large-scale attacks on websites like the LA Times, Tesla, and Politifact, but recently the trend has escalated in an even more startling way. Research shows that thousands of legitimate websites, including some that belong to government institutions, have been cryptojacked. How? Helme puts it this way: “If you want to load a cryptominer on 1,000+ websites, you don’t attack 1,000+ websites, you attack the one website that they all load content from.” In one case, an assistive technology called Text Help was compromised. Any website that used it then cryptojacked visitors, without either the website owners or visitors having a clue. Another  claims 50,000 websites already have crypto-mining malware ready to steal your computer’s power without your knowledge.  have been discovered to contain this strain of cryptojacking on the WordPress platform alone. Both Salon and the hackers behind recent attacks use the same tool — a JavaScript miner called CoinHive. It can be embedded on a webpage and functions in the visitor’s browser window. Hackers have taken the script and implemented it to immediately force visitors to donate their CPU power toward mining Monero coins, or XMR. (What’s that, you ask? Read our guide to ). The internet could become one big, illicit crypto-mining operation. That wasn’t CoinHive’s intent. Instead, its developers “dream about it as an alternative to micro payments, artificial wait time in online games, intrusive ads, and dubious marketing tactics.” It’s a rather clever idea, really. The average PC is much more powerful than needed to browse the web, so why not use a bit of that performance to pay for content? The creators of CoinHive told Motherboard recently that “their reputation couldn’t be worse,” lamenting that they didn’t see the potential of cryptojacking at the time. To be clear, cryptojacking isn’t an easy way for hackers to get rich. If a site has 10–20 active miners all day, CoinHive claims “you can expect a monthly revenue of about 0.3 XMR (~$86).” It’s relatively easy for hackers to implement, however, and the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency makes the payoff hard to trace. Consider it low reward, but  low risk. So long as cryptocurrencies keep rising in value, cryptomining — and its dark side, cryptojacking — will continue to spread. It’s not hard to imagine cryptojacking’s future. Today, ads are everywhere you look on the internet, and off. Ads appear everywhere from YouTube to free software. Cloud cryptomining could provide an alternative, letting you “donate” some processor power for free web content or software. We could also see a future where cryptojacking is constantly in the news — and in much greater potency. The internet could become one big illicit crypto-mining operation, and the fight against that won’t be easy. Hackers will find efficient and more subtle ways of secretly contorting innocent CPUs to make a quick buck. Right now, it’s not yet possible to mine cryptocurrency in-browser using a visitor’s GPU, which would provide much more substantial hashing power. Such a thing can’t be too far away. And it doesn’t stop with in-browser mining. Imagine the way adware works today. You’re installing a piece of software, and you quickly click through a few checkboxes to complete the installation. Without being fully aware of it, you’ve installed a piece of software that generates revenue for a company by inserting ads into your browser. Because it’s invisible, cryptojacking malware tougher to deal with. You might not even notice it quietly humming along in the background as it slows your computer and fills someone’s crypto-wallet. This is certain to happen in a future where cryptocurrency cements its position as an online currency. It’ll give developers and website owners a new way to make legitimate cash from their work — and profit-driven hackers another potent tool in their toolbox.",

Within the following 12 hours,   “Because the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continues to grow, malware operators see the opportunity to include coin mining components in their attacks,” Microsoft stated. “For example, exploit kits are now delivering coin miners instead of ransomware. Scammers are adding coin mining scripts in tech support scam websites. And certain banking trojan families added coin mining behavior.” Once on the PC, the Smoke Loader trojan launched a new instance of Explorer in Windows and placed it in a suspended state. The trojan then carved out a portion of the code used it to run in the system memory and filled that blank space with malware. After that, the malware could run undetected and delete the trojan components stored on the PC’s hard drive or SSD. Now disguised as the typical Explorer process running in the background, the malware launched a new instance of the Windows Update AutoUpdate Client service. Again, a section of the code was carved out, but coin mining malware filled the blank space instead.  Because Smoke Loader needs an internet connection to receive remote commands, it relies on a command and control server located within the experimental, open-source  network infrastructure. According to Microsoft, this server tells the malware to sleep for a period of time, connect or disconnect to a specific IP address, download and execute a file from a specific IP address, and so on. “For coin miner malware, persistence is key. These types of malware employ various techniques to stay undetected for long periods of time in order to mine coins using stolen computer resources,” Microsoft says. That includes making a copy of itself and hiding out in the Roaming AppData folder and making another copy of itself to access IP addresses from the Temp folder.

Some exchanges might actually be forced to suspend business as a result, . “The [Financial Services Administration] will mete out the punishments after uncovering flaws in customer protection and anti-money laundering measures during on-site checks at the exchanges,” Reuters reports. “After the Coincheck heist, the FSA said it would investigate all cryptocurrency exchanges for security gaps.

Coincheck, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, lost an estimated $425 million in NEM tokens to hackers in January 2018. The hackers accessed an unsecured “hot wallet” — a cryptocurrency wallet used to store funds for purchases or exchanges — and made a series of transfers before Coincheck caught on to the breach. “The exchange has promised to repay about $425 million of the cryptocurrency it lost in the theft. Last month it said it has sufficient funds to make the repayments, but declined to specify when it would repay investors affected,” Reuters reports. In 2017 Japan became the first country to officially start regulating crypto exchanges at the national level. To date, 16 exchanges have registered with Japan’s regulatory agencies. Another batch of 16 exchanges have submitted applications, and were permitted to continue operating while their applications were under review by regulators. “After the Coincheck heist, the FSA said it would investigate all cryptocurrency exchanges for security gaps, and ordered them to file reports on system risk management and cryptocurrency storage,” Reuters reported. “The FSA told Coincheck after the cyber heist to bolster its security systems. The second improvement order will focus on customer protection, the sources said, with the FSA monitoring progress of compensating investors affected by the hack.” These moves by financial regulators in Japan underscore just how new all of this is to government agencies.

Bitcoin dropped 6.65 percent to $10,082 after the warning, Ethereum fell 7.55 percent to $756.29, and Bitcoin Cash dropped 9.14 percent to $1,095.77. Waltonchain, Hshare, and IOStoken took the biggest hit with a value decline of more than 22 percent over the last 24 hours. According to the SEC, digital currencies are deemed as investments, or securities, because each digital coin has a value that rises and falls like stock. Even more, many platforms for swapping digital currencies for cash or other cryptocurrencies fall under the “exchange” umbrella as defined by federal securities laws. These platforms should either register themselves as a national securities exchange or be exempt from federal protection. “The SEC staff has concerns that many online trading platforms appear to investors as SEC-registered and regulated marketplaces when they are not,” the SEC states. “Many platforms refer to themselves as ‘exchanges,’ which can give the misimpression to investors that they are regulated or meet the regulatory standards of a national securities exchange.” The SEC notes that many cryptocurrency exchange markets claim strict standards regarding trade, but investors should be aware that these standards are not equal to or meet the same standards enforced by an SEC-registered national securities exchange. Even more, said markets provide books regarding updated bid and asking pricing along with the related data, yet there’s no guarantee that they have the same “integrity” as those provided by an SEC-monitored exchange. As an SEC-listed platform, a cryptocurrency trading market will have rules in place to prevent fraudulent and “manipulative” trades. That includes means for disciplining investors, exchange platform members, and all associated individuals. The market also must comply with the SEC’s rules while also submitting its own rules to the government agency. But the SEC’s statement issued on Wednesday warns of a mix-and-match method involving platforms registered with the agency, and services that don’t fall under the official exchange” banner, but still deal directly with SEC-registered platforms. These services would include digital wallets that receive, hold, and transfer digital currency. “In advancing the SEC’s mission to protect investors, the SEC staff will continue to focus on platforms that offer trading of digital assets and their compliance with the federal securities laws,” the SEC added. The many cryptocurrencies available are decentralized, meaning there is no central agency managing the monies, like a bank. The coins are also protected by cryptography, meaning the monies can’t be traced back to a specific individual. But the SEC’s new encouragement for trading platforms to register with the government indicates a rising interest from Uncle Sam, which recently cracked down on companies selling initial coin offerings, or ICOs. Last week, the agency  to companies, lawyers, investors, and related individuals who may have violated securities laws through these token sales. According to the SEC, all digital currencies should be listed as securities and registered with regulators.",

    "title": "Hackers Can Steal Cryptocurrency Wallet Addresses if Copied to Clipboard | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " New email-based malware dubbed as ComboJack is  to steal cryptocurrency during transactions. Once installed and lurking in the background, the malware grabs the victim’s long cryptocurrency wallet address stored in the Windows clipboard. Due to their extreme length, many users simply copy and paste that string of characters, and that is when ComboJack attacks. Discovered by researchers at the Palo Alto Networks, it’s a variant of a cryptocurrency stealer called CryptoJack. It grabs the address of a victim’s cryptocurrency wallet coped to the clipboard and replaces it with the address of the hacker’s wallet. Thus, victims believe they are transferring digital currency to their personal virtual wallets when instead they’re unknowingly pasting a different destination into the transaction prior to completion. CryptoShuffler was the first malware to use this stealing agent in 2017, but solely focused on Bitcoin. In 2018, ComboJack arrives to target not only  investors, but , Litecoin, Monero, and many other digital currencies. But the route this malware takes can be avoided by simply not opening an emailed attachment from untrusted sources.  According to the report, victims receive emails regarding a lost passport. The shady message requests that the victim view an attachment that’s supposedly a scanned passport in a PDF format for identification purposes. But once victims open the PDF, they are presented with a single line to open an embedded document. Inside this secondary file is an embedded remote object that attacks . “An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when DirectX improperly handles objects in memory,” Microsoft’s database states. “An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.” The embedded remote object downloads a two-part file, one part containing a self-extracting executable, and a second part containing password-protected components to create and install the final payload: ComboJack. The malware then uses a built-in Windows tool to give it system-level privileges, edits the registry to make sure it remains running in the background and enters into an infinite loop. ComboJack then checks the system clipboard every half second for a cryptocurrency wallet address. So why aren’t cryptocurrency users simply manually entering their wallet addresses? Because it’s a pain. Ethereum addresses are 42 characters long while Bitcoin uses 34 characters. The longest is likely Monero, which relies on addresses with characters counts between 95 and 106. This is why users typically  their addresses, which serves as a virtual gold mine for hackers. While the suggestion of manually entering addresses during transactions is out of the question, opening files attached to emails sent from unknown parties is an extremely bad idea. In this case, the big clue starts with the actual poorly written message along with its suspicious attachment. But even after opening the PDF, the request to open another file should be another huge red flag.",

Imagine a game like that, but instead of building a theme park full of thrilling roller-coasters and awe-inspiring attractions, you decorate a basement and fill it with Bitcoin mining equipment. That is what you get with , a tongue-in-cheek Bitcoin mining simulator from independent developer 99 Game Studio. “The early access version will contain a basic mining system, which includes PC building, hardware store and a mining pool. Later on, we may keep working on hardware, running an exchange website, and cloud mining builds,” the developer states on the game’s Steam page. In , you play as a person who jumped into the  market in early 2014, when things were moving quickly for early investors. The protagonist learns knowledge from “elders” and grows to understand the bitterness behind , according to the developer’s synopsis on the Steam store. Not only do you get to build a crypto mining setup, but it appears you’ll be able to customize your hardware, and maybe even join different mining pools. There is not a lot to go on here, but that is partially because the game is still in Steam Early Access. Very Early Access, it seems. “Due to some issues with time and cost, we have to publish the early access. We apologize that this game is not well-polished, can only be called playable, but please be kind to an early access game, we are still working on it,” the developer states on the Steam page. “Currently, we are halfway done of the system design.

Whether or not it will actually teach you enough about crypto mining to give it a go yourself remains to be seen. From what we can tell, it might serve as something of a cautionary tale.",

    "title": "It\u0027s No Movie: Thieves Steal 600 PCs Dedicated to Digital Coin Mining | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " It’s a scenario ripped straight out of the movies: Thieves invaded data centers peppered across Iceland to steal around 600 computers used to mine digital currency. Dubbed as the “Big Bitcoin Heist” by the local media, police are baffled, stating that the series of thefts is the biggest they have ever seen. Even more, the total value of the theft averages around $2 million or just over $3,300 per machine. But don’t let the report fool you. The heist wasn’t one large massive invasion of Iceland’s data centers during a specific night. Three burglaries took place in December while a fourth followed in January. The police waited until the fourth heist and the arrest of 11 individuals before going public. Only two still remain in custody. “This is a grand theft on a scale unseen before,” Olafur Helgi Kjartansson, the police commissioner on the southwestern Reykjanes Peninsula, told the Associated Press. “Everything points to this being a highly organized crime.” So why Iceland? , its geothermal and hydroelectric power plants provide cheap, renewable energy needed to power farms of PCs mining digital currency. The “mining” aspect simply means these PCs help maintain the actual digital currency platform, whether its Bitcoin or , and receive digital coins in return. Right now, a single Bitcoin is worth $11,561 in North America. And that is the fuel behind the theft. Digital currency is not maintained by any one government, nor can it be traced. With 600 computers, these thieves could generate millions in cash without a trace. But there’s a drawback: power. PCs need power to mine digital coins, thus the local police are keeping a close eye across Iceland for large amounts of power consumption in hopes of catching the thieves red-handed. But using all 600 PCs in one centralized location will likely never happen. The fishnet will need to be wider than just catching thieves using loads of power. Iceland’s law officials are now calling on storage space unit providers, electricians, and internet service providers to keep tabs on large pockets of PCs leeching large amounts of power and bandwidth. With Bitcoins, miners can’t just dig up a single coin and exchange it for cash. Instead, potential investors mine a Bitcoin block that generates a little more than 12 digital coins. Smaller miners typically pool their PCs together and receive one Bitcoin for contributing one-twenty-fifth of the computing power to generate a block. The catch is that the next block requires more computing power to mine at the speed of the previous block, pushing miners to add more hardware or steal farms of dedicated PCs as seen in Iceland. Cryptocurrency mining of today really isn’t meant for one specific PC to process. Because the digital currency relies on cryptography, the PC needs to make multiple, intense  each second. The more powerful the hardware, the more operations it can make. A single PC wanting to mine a single block in a single month needs to perform around 3 quadrillion hash operations per second. That is why multiple, networked PCs with dedicated mining hardware is a must.",

A report at Bleeping Computer , dubbed Thanatos, that was unearthed by security experts at MalwareHunter Team. What makes this particular infection noteworthy is that it creates an encrypted file, but the key is not saved anywhere. Whether by accident or design, there’s no way to easily unlock a computer once it’s been compromised.

After a computer is infected, all the encrypted filename extensions are changed to .THANATOS. A ransom note in the form of a README.txt file pops up whenever the user tries to log on, demanding $200 in cryptocurrency to decrypt the files.

The  “dozens” of subpoenas and information requests to determine how sales and pre-sales of ICOs work given they don’t follow the same rules that regulate initial public offerings (IPOs) to protect investors. An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is when a privately held company goes public with its stock. Companies take this route to become publicly traded on the stock market, or to generate funds to expand their footprint. Meanwhile, companies use an ICO to raise funds for a new cryptocurrency business or platform. Investors use legal tender or digital coins to purchase a percentage of the new cryptocurrency in return for digital tokens, financially fueling the platform. Yet it’s the procedure ICOs use that may be generating government involvement. It’s similar to how developers raise money to create games by selling an “early access” token on digital platforms, like Steam, to fund the project. ICOs are listed as “software presale tokens,” and  such as “crowdsale” or “donation” instead of the ICO term to escape federal regulation. But the SEC is catching on, and is now grilling companies that sold digital coins to raise funds, and the lawyers and advisory firms that help with sales. The SEC began demanding information last year, and then rolled out around 80 subpoenas over the last three months to companies and what the SEC calls : individuals who help the sale of ICOs. According to the SEC, virtual currencies should be  and registered with regulators. Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, believes many “promoters” of ICOs and cryptocurrencies simply aren’t complying with securities laws. He asked the agency in January to change that. “Market professionals, especially gatekeepers, need to act responsibly and hold themselves to high standards,” . “To be blunt, from what I have seen recently, particularly in the initial coin offering space, they can do better.” The subpoenas request information about sold cryptocurrencies, how companies market token sales, and the identities of individuals who purchased those tokens. The subpoenas were distributed across multiple cities including Boston, New York, and San Francisco. Unnamed sources who viewed the subpoenas didn’t indicate if an additional wave of subpoenas is on the way to digital coin investors. “Generally, subpoenas are the guided missiles of SEC enforcement actions,” , a securities attorney and co-founder of Prometheum. “There’s going to be a big reckoning for those who have operated outside the federal securities laws, with more SEC enforcement actions and criminal prosecutions in the near future.” Online retailer  on the stock market Thursday after  that it’s currently under investigation by the SEC over its cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary .

    "title": "Report Finds Millennials Want to See More of Cryptocurrency in Games | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " A recent report published by  states that  want to see cryptocurrencies become a normal part of gaming. The report stems from 1,000 gamers located in North America that have already purchased, sold, and traded virtual items online at least once.  According to the report, 75 percent of the 1,000 gamers surveyed want to exchange virtual goods into currency they can use to buy and sell items on other platforms. Two-thirds of those surveyed want more opportunities to use cryptocurrency within popular gaming networks, such as Xbox Live and Sony’s PlayStation Network. The survey found that 80 percent of the millennial participants are interested in using cryptocurrency to make transactions within their favorite games. A larger 87 percent have never even attempted to use digital coins in games and online gaming networks. For those that have bought, sold, and traded virtual goods, 64 percent of those gamers feel the process needs major improvement. “The virtual gaming items market is plagued by high fees and exchange rates, rampant fraud, inefficient intermediaries and slow transaction times — issues that could be solved by the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency,” the company says.   Finally, millennials interested in using cryptocurrency within games rate ease of use as the biggest lure followed by the platform’s heightened security and low exchange rates.  Right now, many games offer their own currency to buy digital goods in exchange for real-world cash. For instance, by investing in Silver for , you can purchase cosmetic items such as weapon ornaments, emotes, armor shaders, and so on. In , gamers purchase Crowns to buy virtual goods like pets, houses, mounts, and even additional content. On a network level, Microsoft had a virtual currency system for Xbox Live for years, called Microsoft Points or Xbox Live Points, but retired its virtual coins for real-world cash/credit in August 2013. But there is a good chance both Microsoft and Sony could jump on the cryptocurrency bandwagon given the rising popularity of digital coin investments. What is missing from the equation is a digital currency for use within any game. “The global nature of the online gaming community coupled with the tech-savviness of the millennial generation means the adoption rate of cryptocurrencies within gaming should only increase with time,” Worldwide Asset eXchange states. Worldwide Asset Exchange (WAX) provides a global, decentralized marketplace for virtual goods. Customers can sell any virtual asset on their marketplace in return for WAX Tokens that can be exchanged for cryptocurrency. The platform relies on a blockchain providing a real-time catalog of items.",

    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrency miners continue to change the landscape of the GPU market, and it looks like they may have even pushed AMD’s GPU sales to record highs. According to , AMD’s GPU market share rose from 27 percent to 33 percent in the tail end of 2017, and Nvidia’s market share fell from 72 percent to 66 percent. That’s a big change, and one that directly affects AMD and Nvidia’s bottom lines. Part of the reason for the shift in AMD’s favor could be simply because of the GPU manufacturer’s already low prices. Compared to Nvidia, AMD  have always been the favorite of budget-conscious PC gamers, offering  the same amount of graphical horsepower as comparable Nvidia graphics cards at slightly lower prices. Those naturally lower prices meant AMD  could bear a higher price increase while still remaining viable to cryptocurrency miners looking to buy  in bulk. According to , graphics cards manufacturers sold around three million GPUs to cryptocurrency miners in 2017, or roughly $776 million in total sales. That’s nearly a billion dollars pumped into the GPU market by cryptocurrency miners alone. It’s a growing segment of Nvidia and AMD’s markets so it will be interesting to see how each company deals with shortage issues without alienating this growing industry. Tech Radar speculates that the boost to AMD’s sales could have been the result of Nvidia’s open support of PC gamers who have criticized cryptocurrency miners for causing a GPU shortage and pushing prices to unacceptable highs. Feeling more supported by AMD could have meant more miners bought AMD products, but it’s more likely that crypto outfits just looked at prices and picked whichever one would maximize their returns. Nvidia has reportedly floated the idea of developing graphics cards designed  in order to offer an alternative for crypto miners, so gamers aren’t priced out of the GPU market entirely. The problem remains that . Increasing production of GPUs and introducing a new product like the proposed “Turing” cards could mitigate the current price increases in the short term, but it remains to be seen if prices will fall or if PC gamers will just have to deal with the new reality of paying double for midrange .",

Instead of sitting on 700 Bitcoins, he in fact has none. He did have some once, but it wasn’t much, and even then he was paid by an intermediary firm which conducted the original transactions for Bitcoin during the sale of his 2014 album, . Citing at the time that he wanted to “stay with the times,” according to , when 50 Cent released said album four years ago he allowed fans to pay for it with the flagship cryptocurrency. At the time Bitcoin was worth around $660 each. While it was thought that Bitcoin represented a reasonable portion of the rapper’s earnings from the album (around half a million dollars), we now know that that wasn’t the case. As revealed in documents Jackson submitted to courts last week published by , he was only ever paid in dollar amounts by a company called Central Nervous LLC, which converted all Bitcoin payments into U.S. dollars. Those payments numbered in the low hundreds and were for a handful of dollars each, equating to perhaps a few thousand in total. Jackson initially , citing the . “Not bad for a kid from South Side, I’m so proud of me,” he said. He has now stated categorically that he does not “personally own, and have never owned, either a Bitcoin account or any Bitcoins.” He lated clarified that the reason he did not debunk the original story when published, was because he subscribes to the idea that any story that does not damage his brand, no matter how untrue, does not need to be denied. Although 50 Cent has been one of the more successful rappers in recent decades, he has faced his own share of financial difficulties. He famously , though maintained hold of properties and even posted images of himself around the time with stacks of cash. This latest misunderstanding with the potential Bitcoin treasure trove appears to be little more than a continuation of that narrative. It’s a pity for Jackson that he didn’t hang on to any Bitcoin he could have had, as some experts we spoke to recently believe it could be . At least he didn’t lose it though.

    "detailContent": " Cloud mining, or remote cryptocurrency mining, is a contentious topic. Using a remote server to mine currency for you seems perfect for people who don’t have the money or time to set up a home operation, but it also seems a bit too good to be true. If a cloud mining company just mined Bitcoin itself, wouldn’t it make more money? To find the answer to some of these concerns, and to learn more about cloud mining in general, we reached out to  head of public relations, Edgar Bers.   Cloud mining is using hashing power to make calculations […] remotely. Like you would do when you render something. You may buy a cloud service that uses video cards to render something, or when you create a website and you need a web server where you put the files where you use for your website, you store them somewhere remotely. Cloud mining is kind of the same way.  “For god’s sake, we are not an investment platform.” We don’t feel that HashFlare an investment platform. You may consider it so because you put money in one end and get money out the other, but for us it’s just hosting a service. We host hardware, you purchase hashing power and you mine [with] it. We don’t care what you mine, what you do, we legally just provide you with rent of equipment and that’s it for us. Many people say that cloud mining is a form of making profit and capital gain. We have never promised any profit, and we cannot, because it is not for us to say what is the Bitcoin price or Bitcoin difficulty, especially now after the rally where bitcoin grew as high as 20k and now it’s just over 10 and may fall over () […] There is a lot of  in the cryptomarket, a lot of speculation. For god’s sake, we are not an investment platform. This is not a market you want to offer investment options in. If you want to mine, you want this risk, here is how to buy the equipment. It’s already connected, if you want it, here you go. : Edgar did later state later that all HashFlare users do make a profit of some kind. “At the end of the day, every contract resulted in a positive dollar profit,” Bers said. “However, simply  is practically the same in terms of dollar profit. Especially if you get in at the right price.”  HashFlare started in 2013. We were developing and selling hardware for mining Bitcoins, but soon we realized that shipping equipment is not really the best way to go. You can never be sure about delivery, that the equipment won’t be broken when it arrives. The second thing is trust, when you pay a lot of money, $2,000, $3,000 and must wait a month or two, you start to get nervous if it will arrive in time. It also incurs other problems like shipment costs. You may order a miner from us, it will cost $2,500 dollars, but at the border control you have to pay extra tax, because you’re importing electronics or machinery. “[We have to] wake up at night if something shutdowns overnight.” After that we decided that we should probably think of another way to sell the hardware, and it was back then we developed the remote mining platform. At that time, when we tried to push that model to the public [though], we got more questions about how to use the system than actual orders. So we had to get back into the thinking bubble and ended up with HashFlare  There is mining equipment that stays in the datacenter. It mines, it does the operation, it mines Bitcoin. Bitcoin comes to our, so to say, central wallet. It’s not an individual customer’s wallet. It’s a central wallet that’s cold. We keep it private and secure so that no one can hack it. If you have a contract with us, it means that you have a certain amount of hashing power which equals to certain amount of cryptocurrency mined per, for example, day. In order for that equipment to mine, we have to provide electricity, the network, we have to get rid of the dust, we have to  systems, manage everything. [We have to] wake up at night if something shutdowns overnight, electricity cuts off – maintenance work, technical operations. These operations are part of the maintenance fee.   A post shared by  (@hashflare.io) on  In HashFlare you have your user account. There you have this number for how much hash power you have, what’s your balance, and so on. That’s just a number though. It’s not real Bitcoins, it’s just a number that you have. The Bitcoins are kept in our cold storage. Once you request a withdrawal, the money is sent from our cold storage to the wallet that you put into our system. We mine it, we store it, then we pay it, and we take out the maintenance fee for mining, storing electricity, and everything.  Obviously when the Bitcoin price is rising, we see a lot of new customers buying. When the Bitcoin price is falling, we see an influx of blame coming towards us. Since we are working in quite a young market and most of them see us as a money generation source, they think they just throw money into their screen and the next day they are millionaires. That’s fine, I’m not here to teach people, I’m just here to show them what’s happening at our end. Our business model is not really damaged, we are not suffering from Bitcoin fluctuations because we have been working for over four years. We don’t spend all the cash that we earn. We have money to pay for our support people that we accumulate before crisis, like prices lowering, Bitcoin difficulty not lowering.  We are not providing , we are providing hashing power for rent. That’s it. If they said you are not allowed to do that, under that regulation services that provide hashing power to video rendering would also be damaged. That’s why we think that would never happen. “Bitcoin is not really good for money laundering because it’s pseudo anonymous.” We are most concerned about regulations that affect keeping hardware and consuming electricity. Because regulations are applied to the bottleneck where the trading for money is happening. Cryptocurrency exchanges, they get the first hit as they are the point in the community that allow for you to pay for something – to take money, to exchange money, that’s a regulated practice. You need to have KYC () there. I think we are also going to need to have a KYC procedure. I don’t know 100 percent, but I think considering what’s happening, we will one day need to know every customer who is giving us money and getting cryptocurrency from their mining […] to make sure that there is no money laundering involved. [However] just half a year ago, the FCA in the UK, said that Bitcoin is not really good for money laundering because it’s pseudo anonymous. You have wallet numbers, all transactions are , there are blacklists of wallets. If you have bitcoins that are associated with blacklisted wallet address, from half year ago, your bitcoins might be seized if you tried to withdraw them in fiat.  Everyone at every corner, every regulator, every government, especially every banker, they love to say that Bitcoin is a scam. If you are investing in Bitcoin, next year you’re going to lose all your money. Guess who’s going to earn that money? I bet bankers have Bitcoins, they just don’t tell anyone. That’s probably the reason we must be so accurate when we say what we are doing, because it’s all about how it’s perceived. If you take money for charity that’s a good thing, but if you just take money and spend it on yourself, that’s technically charity, but you’re not helping anyone. It’s a game of terms of how you name things how you present them not just to customers but also to regulators. Even when we say what kind of return on investment (ROI) you can expect, we always mention that all these calculations are made using open source calculators and these numbers are valid on the date of calculations. The next day you see an email from us saying that there is a new ROI you need to follow the links and recalculate to be sure. The volatility of this market practically doesn’t allow you to become an investment provider. You cannot be sure of anything.  If you consider hosting, electricity, rent – if we could pay for everything, for all the commodities that are required to mine, if we could pay in Bitcoins, then it wouldn’t be a problem. We would be mining just for ourselves, but we have people to maintain this system. We have to pay rent for the datacenters, we have to pay to our support agents. Even I am here because I receive a salary or else I would work somewhere else. To generate money that could be used for our day to day operations, you need classical funds like Dollars and Euros. So that’s why we sell it. “I bet bankers have Bitcoins, they just don’t tell anyone.” Obviously, we mine for ourselves as well, using the hardware that is not sold. Because whenever you buy hardware form HashFlare, there is no red signal somewhere. We don’t run with the miner and connect it. It’s already there, it’s already mining. We just reallocate the profits.  . Another thing is we are thinking of maybe adding more cryptocurrencies for mining, but the problem is there are no cryptocurrencies to add that are worth adding. There is Bitcoin Cash, but it’s not really Bitcoin, it’s not really cash.  Regulations didn’t kill stock markets 100 years ago. Didn’t kill the mortgage market 10 years ago. Regulations are not to kill, but to save people from losing funds. At the end of the day, non-professional investors are still going to lose money, because the hype is too much, everything is too much right now. It really feels like the whales are trying to shake the weak hands who are going to sell [right now] to have . Cryptocurrency business will hit one trillion capitalization this year, that’s for sure. And in order for that to happen, huge capital has to get in. More than 85 percent of Bitcoin is in 0.5 percent of wallets. You can imagine what the distribution rate is here. I am more than sure the same distribution is within any market. If that’s true, then well, we’re going to see these whales come in. When they do, when they come in, we’re going to see capitalization grow by a lot. ",

More specifically, Uncle Sam expects his share of the cash sales made from digital currency within the calendar year. Cryptocurrency brokers can’t protect you from the IRS either, as seen with a recent batch of . According to Coinbase, the company  in December 2016 to produce records relating to 500,000 customers. Coinbase fought the IRS in court and reached a compromise: Specific, limited categories of information that only legally tie up 13,000 customers. The company is now required to produce this information and submit notices to all that are currently under investigation. The company says it must provide the IRS with taxpayer IDs, names, birth dates, and addresses. The information also includes historical transaction records for certain higher-transacting customers from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015. Unfortunately, the company cannot provide legal or tax advice to all customers involved in the IRS’ request. “Because  received a summons on December 8, 2016, and more than six months passed before our challenges to the summons were resolved by the court, the period of limitations under sections 6501 and 6531 of the Internal Revenue Code (title 26 of the U.S. Code) were suspended beginning as of June 8, 2017 and continuing through the final resolution of Coinbase’s response to the summons,” the company says. “This may be relevant to the tax returns that you have filed for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 calendar years.” The IRS initially wanted nine classes of information: But as stated, Coinbase refused. Eight months later, the “narrowed summons” include the following: Capital gain or loss stemming from property transactions, including virtual currency, must be reported with IRS Form 8949 that’s attached to Schedule D on Form 1040. Form 8949 contains a space to describe the type of property sold, which was only used by 800 to 900 Americans when they electronically filed taxes in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Given the financial state of cryptocurrency, the IRS believes there should be additional reported gains, hence the tax request to Coinbase. According to Coinbase, it serves more than 10 million customers spanning across 32 supported countries, generating more than $50 billion in exchanged currency. The San Francisco-based company brokers exchanges of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin for a per-transaction fee. In North America, Coinbase charges a 1.49 percent fee for converting digital currency into cash.

    "detailContent": " Amazon can be a great place to find good deals on everything from books to smartphones, but a new cryptocurrency startup is hoping to provide even steeper savings.  allows users to purchase  — provided they pay in Bitcoin, that is.  allows users to select a discount from a sliding scale depending on how fast they want their items. The scale ranges from five percent to 33 percent, with higher discounts taking more time to fulfill. Users who select the five percent discount option can expect to receive their products within two to five days and those orders are fulfilled by Purse.io. This does mean that even the lowest discount leads to slower transactions than ordering directly from Amazon Prime. Those seeking to get larger discounts will need to wait a bit longer for their items. Once you have selected the discount you want, Purse will match you with an appropriate Earner. These Earners will purchase your item using Amazon gift cards in exchange for a buyer’s Bitcoins. This process is also managed within Purse’s ecosystem, but these orders are fulfilled by third parties that aren’t directly associated with Purse. As mentioned, buyers can select a discount rate as high as 33 percent, though Earners are under no obligation to accept any of the offers. The site warns that a discount that is set too high might mean that the offer won’t be accepted. However, buyers can always edit and resubmit their orders with lower discounts to make it easier to find an Earner. In general, Purse says that it sees average discount rates of 15 to 18 percent and suggests that as a good place to start. One thing that should be noted is that Purse does charge a fee for using the name your discount feature. The fees range from 1.9 percent to 4.7 percent for the higher options. This does offset the discounts a bit, so buyers should bear these fees in mind. The biggest hurdle that newcomers might find on Purse is that they cannot make payments in cash.

    "title": "Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, Cryptocurrency\u0027s Elusive Creator? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the finance industry and the way people perceive the concept of money. Digital assets that use cryptography to secure transactions and creation, cryptocurrencies are the first form of decentralized currency — meaning no bank or middleman controls its use. One of the best-known forms of cryptocurrency is . Created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is the first (and currently most valuable) cryptocurrency in the world. December 2017 saw the highest recorded value of the currency at more than $19,000. While the price of a single bitcoin has since , even that is incredibly impressive considering bitcoin was only worth $1,000 at the start of the year. Unlike other forms of currency, bitcoin is not backed by any central organization (like a bank or country) or by a physical item (like gold). It sits atop a , where a highly sophisticated mathematical formula creates scarcity and allows users to “mine” portions of the currency. Creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is also credited with the invention of the first blockchain database, which set the foundation for more forms of cryptocurrency to emerge like Ethereum and Litecoin. However, despite the fact that Nakamoto is such an important figure in the world of modern finance, not much is known about the elusive cryptocurrency creator. Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to be a Japanese-born man in his 40s, but the thing is, no one really knows for sure. Whether Nakamoto is a man, woman, or group of individuals is unknown as well, because the mysterious creator has somehow remained anonymous — despite the rising popularity of the cryptocurrencies that Nakamoto helped create. Which begs the questions: Where did the name Satoshi Nakamoto come from if no one actually knows who this person is? Even though the name Satoshi Nakamoto is being used a placeholder until the real creator(s) come forward, the name itself certainly didn’t show up randomly. An online profile under the name Satoshi Nakamoto was first used on the P2P Foundation website in 2008, a peer-to-peer networking site where the first papers on bitcoin were released. Another account under the same name  released Version 0.1 of the bitcoin software on Sourceforge in 2009. It’s clear that whether or not Satoshi Nakamoto is the cryptocurrency creator’s actual name or not, it’s the name they want us to know them by. Nakamoto also communicated with users via email for a few years after the software’s release, but as not been involved with bitcoin since 2011. Nakamoto’s anonymity hasn’t stopped people from trying to figure out their true identity. , which was released back in 2014, claimed to have discovered the true identity of Nakamoto, and pointed to a retired Japanese-American man living in California named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto. Dorian Nakamoto denied any role in the creation of bitcoin and says that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto, but some people weren’t convinced. The day after the Newsweek piece ran, a comment from the original Satoshi Nakamoto on P2P  “I am not Dorian Nakamoto.” Another feature, this time in , claimed the creator of bitcoin was an American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo.  While Szabo’s career and interest in bitcoin might point to his involvement in the creation of the first cryptocurrency, he has denied that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, so the trail runs cold again. But the search for Satoshi Nakamoto has posed more questions, like what the unmasking of the bitcoin creator would actually mean for the future of the currency and cryptocurrencies as a whole. Many people don’t seem to care who Nakamoto is, and unless Nakamoto one day decides to step out from the shadows, there isn’t really much we can do to find out their identity — and probably not much to be gained from it either. Bitcoin hasn’t and never existed in a vacuum. It wasn’t something that suddenly showed up out of the blue, but was created by building off the ideas of multiple people over several decades. And while Satoshi Nakamoto helped push the industry to new limits, they weren’t the only person/people capable of doing so. Satoshi Nakamoto has been instrumental in the cryptocurrency market for sure, but they also haven’t really been involved in it in any meaningful way since 2010. Most of the open-source code has been rewritten by a group of programmers  drawing focus away from Nakamoto. So while it might be interested in finally learn who Satoshi Nakamoto really is, it wouldn’t likely have a big impact. However, despite their anonymity, Satoshi Nakamoto is estimated to be worth upwards of $20 billion (although the exact number varies widely from $6-20 billion, but they’re still a millionaire whichever way you spin it) and could be the 44th richest person in the world, according to Forbes. Knowing who holds that much money (5% of the entire bitcoin stash) could definitely have lasting implications, but won’t likely affect the future of cryptocurrencies as a whole. So for now the identity of the “father of cryptocurrency” will remain a mystery. But bitcoin and other currencies like it will continue to have lasting impacts on money for a very long time.",

    "detailContent": " Robinhood Markets is now offering a service called  for the commission-free trading of  and  digital currencies. The company is currently rolling out its Robinhood Crypto platform in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and New Hampshire and plans to launch the service in other states in the near future.  Founded in 2013, the California-based company provides means for investors to purchase stock and trade investment funds without the need to pay a commission. In return for using this service, Robinhood Markets generates revenue from interest earned from margin lending and cash balances. To reduce its overhead, the company doesn’t provide customer-facing offices or analytical tools. “We believe that the financial system should help the rest of us, not just the wealthy,” the company says. “We’ve cut the fat that makes other brokerages costly, like manual account management and hundreds of storefront locations, so we can offer zero-commission trading.” Robinhood provides a mobile app for , Apple Watch, and iPhone to purchase and sell stocks listed on U.S.-based exchanges. It’s also rolling out a web-based version with a current waiting list of 1,088,614 potential users, and a free options trading service with a current waiting line of 578,290 potential customers. Both are rolling out in waves throughout 2018. According to Robinhood, around four million individuals use its free service, saving more than $1 billion in commission costs. But the company also serves up a “gold” version that lends out money strictly for purchasing stock; cryptocurrency is not an option. It’s a margin account, thus your gains and losses increase. And while you’re not charged for transactions, interest, or other fees, you are required to pay a monthly fee to pay for the money you borrow. Robinhood’s current foundation powers its new cryptocurrency trading service. And while Robinhood Crypto only enables trading of Bitcoins and Ethereum in just five states, you can pull up the mobile app and track the market data of 16 cryptocurrencies. For instance, you can see that the current price for a Bitcoin is $9,910.44, down around six percent over the last 24 hours. “Over the past few weeks, we’ve been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm towards Robinhood Crypto and are excited to contribute to the cryptocurrency community in a meaningful way,” the company said. In addition to Robinhood Crypto, the company also introduced Robinhood Feed, a means to chat with other Robinhood-based investors in real-time regarding market swings, news, and cryptocurrencies. But like the new Crypto platform, the rollout is limited. Only a small number of people can use the platform, for now, to provide feedback and help evolve the real-time chat client for a wider release. Robinhood and other online brokers are causing ripples across the stock-trading market. Due to their commission-free trading,  to $5 after Fidelity’s per-trade fee fell from $8 to $5. Meanwhile, Interactive Brokers charges a $1 fee per trade, one of the cheapest trading fees you will find on the internet. Before brokers like Robinhood began offering free transactions, the per-share trade fee averaged around $7.",

    "detailContent": " As much as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin might have an inherent volatility that encourages investors to jump on great opportunities, exchange bugs aren’t one of them. In the case of Japan’s  accidentally setting Bitcoin prices to $0, one enterprising investor attempted to pull out 2,200 trillion yen from the service, or around $20 trillion. The bug in question meant that the government registered Zaif exchange had a 20-minute window last week whereby Bitcoin prices were locked at $0 for all purchases. Unsurprisingly, many customers took advantage of this flaw and tried to , only to try and resell it later for an enormous profit. Nobody was quite as ambitious as one customer though, who attempted to profit more than 100 times that of Bitcoin’s entire global market value. Once the bug in its system was discovered, Zaif quickly voided all transactions that took place during that window, , but that hasn’t stopped the potential Bitcoin trillionaire from trying to hold on to their impossible returns. This exchange bug and related fallout come at an interesting time for cryptocurrency relations in Japan, which recently announced it as an accepted means of payment. That is a move that is rare in all economies, let alone first world ones, and is likely to be used as a case study by others in the effectiveness of such a tactic. Although  about global attempts to ban or regulate cryptocurrencies, countries like China have taken extreme measures to do so and there is a wonder of which precedent will have the biggest impact moving forward. Zaif and 15 other exchanges have been registered in Japan so far, with plans for all of them to form part of a regulatory body for the cryptocurrency industry come April. Together they will set out rules and regulations to help maintain a healthy industry whilst helping to prevent the illegal practices cryptocurrency is occasionally used for, such as online purchasing of illicit substances and money laundering. It’s not clear yet what such a regulatory body would do to exchanges that were found in breach of its rules, though penalties of some sort would be implemented.",

    "detailContent": " The South Korean government recently enacted regulations that require all  accounts to be associated with real identities. The move comes amid an investment frenzy over the past few months, and the South Korean government hoped the new regulations would stem speculative trading that has recently taken off in that country. The value of bitcoin dropped 12 percent once this news hit, and  followed suit, falling 6 percent, according to . Since then, bitcoin has recovered, to $11,502 as of 7:15 am on February 20, 2018. “Cryptocurrency speculation has been irrationally overheated in Korea. The government can’t let this abnormal situation of speculation go on any longer,” the South Korean government said in a statement, as reported by . TechCrunch has a , suggesting that the move to ban anonymous cryptocurrency accounts will have the fortunate side-effect of making it harder for North Korea to infiltrate the South’s crypto markets. TechCrunch  that the Kim Jong Un regime may be using cryptocurrency trading as a side business for the Kim family. The new regulations banning anonymous accounts should make it harder for the North to turn a profit on cryptocurrency trading. The new regulations are tricky for a number of reasons, not least of which is because they will do away with one of the alluring features cryptocurrencies offer — anonymity. The South Korean government is also worried that putting regulations on cryptocurrencies could have the effect of legitimizing them in the eyes of everyday people, who have recently been swept up in the cryptocurrency craze. “It’s really tricky for the government,” said S.G. Lee, chairman of the Korean Fintech Industry Association. “They are worried about giving a wrong perception to the people.” According to The New York Times, the new regulations are a warning shot for the overheated crypto market and investors who are making a killing off of the rampant speculation. The South Korean government hopes to cool things down by making it clear to investors that it will, if necessary, crack down hard on cryptocurrencies. More recently, South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon reinforced the government’s message that it does not seek to hold down the nascent market, as China has done. As , Dong-yeon said in a recent statement that “this is no intention to ban or suppress cryptocurrency (market).” This statement comes on the heels of South Korea’s discovery of $600 million worth of illegal cryptocurrency foreign exchange trading, and reinforces the message that regulation is the more immediate option for addressing concerns, as opposed to an outright ban on trading. Then, as , the South Korean government went even further in calming nerves by saying that it is in favor of “normal” cryptocurrency trading and that its Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is working to normalize digital asset trading. As Arthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, said, “South Korea did not ban bitcoin. We’ve now gone up almost double in the last few weeks, and I think a lot of this is poeple coming around to the fact that bitcoin trading isn’t going anywhere.” All of this comes in the wake of several  of cryptocurrency exchanges going under after losing millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies to malicious hackers. TechCrunch reports South Korean crypto exchange YouBit folded recently after losing $35 million. ",

He believes traditional assets are still best for those who want to generate lucrative interest from long-term investments. Cryptocurrencies on the whole are still in the infancy stage, and don’t generate interest.  “Cryptocurrencies are still a new and hyper-volatile asset class and could drop to near-zero at any time,” he states. “Don’t put in more money than you can afford to lose. If you’re trying to figure out where to store your life savings, traditional assets are still your safest bet.” Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer, proposed  at the end of 2013. He helped get the platform up and running in July 2015 after selling an initial run to early adopters in 2014. Ethereum is the overall decentralized transaction platform while Ether are the digital coins. Currently, just one coin’s value is around $939, but that same coin was worth a mere $13 just a year ago. The problem with cryptocurrency is that its value is volatile. For instance, on November 19, 2017,  in real-world cash.

    "title": "Taryn Southern Made An Album Entirely Produced By Artificial Intelligence | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": " Music has been made on computers for decades, but the technology has traditionally been much more utilitarian than collaborative when it comes to the music-making process. In recent years, however, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved to a level where it can help artists actually create music for  and even help craft . Singer-songwriter and YouTuber Taryn Southern has decided to push the limits of AI composition, putting the sound of her new album into the “hands” of four AI programs: Amper Music, IBM’s , , and AIVA. Aptly titled the albumwill be the first of its kind to be fully composed with and totally produced by AI when it releases in May. While each AI program is unique, they generally create music by following certain parameters (genre, tempo, style). Artists input music for the programs to analyze, and the machines learn the structure in order to create original music in minutes. Specializing in creating classical music, AIVA got so good at composing it became the first non-human to be  Ahead of the February 20 release of , the latest song from  Southern spoke with Digital Trends about the album-making process, how time-consuming making music with AI is, and its exciting potential to break down traditional barriers in the music industry.  Last January, I was reading an article in , actually, about the future of artificial intelligence and how it was being used in creative ways. At that point, out of curiosity, I was reading a lot about AI more for its data applications for enterprising companies. Once I learned it was being used for musical applications, I was really intrigued. So, I started reaching out to companies in the article asking if I could get access to their platform. Within a few months I was experimenting with a few platforms [and] it became evident that I could create what I felt was similar to what I was able to do on my own, before artificial intelligence.  “You can literally make music with the touch of a button.” I think the cool thing about these technologies is you can literally make music with the touch of a button. Something like my album has been a bit more involved, though. Or maybe, more involved. [Laughs]. I could make songs how I want to hear them and have the right structure in place. With Amper, you can make it as easy or as difficult as you want. I would iterate anywhere between 30-70 times off a song within Amper. Once I’m happy with the song, I download the stems [individual music elements of a multi-track recording], and then I rearrange the various sections of the instrumentation that I really like, and cut what I don’t like. I do that to create the structure of the song, like .  I started with one mood, then I started converting it to several others. Changing the key. Changing the tempo. I think I downloaded 30 stems, arranged the song, and then created a new template beat that was of the same key and genre, but as a hip hop beat. I think the original beat I went with was a cinematic, uplifting genre. Then once it had a really strong song structure that I really liked, I took the same parameters, popped them into a hip hop beat to get some of the drums, and some of the percussive elements. Basically, [it was] two variations of the song, within different genre parameters with the same rhythmic structure.  Yeah. For the [ beat, I probably iterated 15-20 times, to get something where I liked the rhythm and the melodic structure. From there, once I had a sound song structure, I went into a different preset and set the genre parameters the same, so I could take sounds to add to the song. That adds to that layered feeling that you get from a song like which has about 35 stems.  Every song on the album has a different process depending on the technology used, [and] depending on how quickly I could get something I really loved. There is another song I did on Amper that I only iterated on three times. A lot of those iterations are around the instrumentation, [and] playing with different instruments. With something like Watson, I’m basically taking the code, running it through terminal, then taking all of the stems, pushing them through a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation] and changing the instruments myself to whatever I see fit. There’s a lot more involvement in working with a platform like that. On the plus side, [Watson] gives musicians who potentially have more background … in writing music potential opportunity to have more creative license … where Amper might be easier for beginner musicians and early music creators who want a bit more of a full production experience.  Magenta is open source, so that was a matter of going on Github, reading documentation, and downloading it. Fortunately, I had some friends at Magenta who have been very helpful answering questions and helping me out. They also have a number of different tools outside of Magenta, like , that are really cool, AI based tools that can help you customize a sound, or song, or tones even more than you had access to through other programs. “I’m working on a song right now that’s basically an ode to revolution and I call it my .” With Watson Beat I just reached out to everyone I could at Watson telling them how I’d love to get my hands on this. They emailed me back last fall, and … [via Google hangout] they set it all up on my computer and walked me through the whole program. They’ve been really helpful and I’ve been in direct contact with them quite a bit. I’m really impressed with the background code they’ve done on this and the program. It’s really intuitive. What I like about Watson is being able to inject the code with any kind of data or inspiration point of music that I’d like. For instance, I’m working on a song right now that’s basically an ode to revolution and I call it my “Blockchain song.” It’s a song that’s inspired by the blockchain revolution, but I really wanted it to encompass this idea of revolution. So, I’ve been feeding Watson various songs, as far back as the 1700s, that represent revolution, trying to see what it can … glean from those songs to make a new anthemic, revolution song.  [Laughs] I started with 1700, 1800 revolution songs, because there’s no copyright issue with those. Currently, the rules around teaching AI based on copyrighted works is still a grey area. So I’m trying to play within the bounds of what’s legally acceptable at this point. I thought it would also be interesting to have these really old songs as inspiration points. It’s probably 15 songs from the 1700s and 1800s that are old-school anthemic songs, and it was really fun to have the AI algorithm learn from those songs and then force that function through anthemic pop structure that Watson already designated to see what kind of things it’d come with.  I figured it out myself. I think, as is the case with all of these new technologies, you’re writing the rules as you go. Ten years ago, I don’t think there were many people talking about artificial intelligence and copyright infringement. These are conversations that are happening in every single industry, not just music. I actually just did a panel at the copyright society this week that was digging into these predicaments. They asked, “What kind of attributions are given if artificial intelligence is learning off copyrighted works?” A lot of these things have to be figured out, but there aren’t any hard and fast rules on this.  I have run popular songs through, just to see what would happen. Usually what comes out of it is something that is not even close to resembling the original piece. It depends on the AI. Sometimes it’s just running pattern recognition on the chord structure. Other times it’s running statistical analysis, saying “if there’s an F-chord here, then you’re 70 percent likely to get a G-chord after the F-chord or an E-minor chord after the F-chord.” … If we’re looking at this from a purely theoretical point of view, I think that holding an AI accountable for stealing from copyrighted works would be very similar to holding a human accountable who’s grown up listening to The Beatles their entire life and now writes pop music. [ Laughs]. … If we’re looking at a really sophisticated AI program that is built … similar to the way our own neural networks integrate and mimic information, then you could think of an AI as a really sophisticated human. [Laughs]. Even artists joke that some of the best music producers out there, like Max Martin, are just really advanced AI … Many of his songs have repeatable patterns that can be studied and mimicked.  I look at each of these AI programs as creative collaborators, so they’re produced in collaboration with Amper, AIVA, Magenta and Watson. There are 11 songs in total, although I might be adding two songs.  One program per song. I’ve probably used Watson and Amper the most. If I end up with 12-13 songs, those would be additional songs from Amper.  AIVA was trained specifically off classical music. It primarily writes symphonies. I have two songs with AIVA that I love that are really unique. Because they were trained in classical music, it’s like, “How do we take these classical interpretations and turn them into pop songs?” So, they have a very different kind of feel to them, but they’re symphonic in the way that my Amper songs have symphonic and synth sounds.  I 100 percent agree. I think that the most exciting aspect of all of this is it will democratize access. I know that’s a really scary thing to the industry, and for understandable reasons. No one wants to lose their job and no one wants to feel like they might be beat out of their own game, vis-a-vis a computer. But at the same time, the music industry for so long has been kind of an old-boys club. … It has many gatekeepers. If you want to produce a really well done album, it’s expensive. You have to find great producers, [and they] are not cheap. Sometimes the artists don’t make any money. As a YouTuber who grew up in the digital content revolution, I love when new tools come along that allow me to be scrappy and create without worrying about how I’m going to pay my bills. That might be the entry point for someone to say, “Wow, I love music. I’m going to do more of this.” … I feel like these kind of things are actually just helpful in widening the creative community and allowing more people to join the creative class.  I’m sure I will. I can only imagine these are just the first few technologies to become available and there will be many more and they will evolve. I’m really excited to see how they evolve. But, they really do make my life easier as the artist, because I can focus on so many of the others things that I love to focus on in the creation process.",

    "detailContent": " Salon Media Group now offers a method to block advertisements on its Salon website, but there’s a catch: you must allow the company to mine digital coins in the background. This requirement stems from  explaining why visitors receive a popup when loading the Salon website using an advertisement blocker. Product manufacturers and service providers create revenue for through advertisements. Even if you don’t purchase or subscribe to a related product, media outlets still get paid for displaying those advertisements. But that relationship is a bit different online: If you block advertisements, websites don’t get a piece of the per-page-view advertisement revenue pie. “Like most media companies, Salon pays its bills through advertising and we profoundly appreciate our advertising partners and sponsors,” the company says. “In this traditional arrangement between reader and publisher, we are able to offer our readers a free reading experience in exchange for serving them ads.” Because Salon is an online-only media outlet, it doesn’t have the additional revenue generated from print like newspapers and magazines. It depends solely on advertisements and doesn’t get paid to create content with ad blockers on. That said, Salon came up with two alternatives for readers who don’t want advertisements splashed across the pages: Purchasing the ad-free app for  and iOS or let the company mine digital coins in the background. The argument is that when browsing Salon, you’re not using the full hardware potential of your PC’s processor. The company wants to use this untapped resource to generate , a specific type of cryptocurrency (digital cash) that is secure, private, and untraceable. To do this, the Salon website will  within the webpage code to generate coins by accessing your processor. Unfortunately, the mining process won’t be invisible. As we have seen with other websites using mining code in the background, processor use goes into high gear, activating all related fans to cool the chip and its surrounding area. The PC’s performance could significantly drop in the process until you close the tab displaying Salon’s website. The company even admits that you will hear fans running during the mining process. “We automatically detect your current processing usage and assign a portion of what you are not using to this process,” the FAQ states. “Should you begin a process that requires more of your computer’s resources, we automatically reduce the amount we are using for calculations.  This process will use more of your computer power and electricity than if you were browsing the site without an ad blocker.” If Salon readers decide to let the company mine Monero in the background, advertisements will not appear on its pages. Salon will save your opt-in preference for 24 hours. After that, you’re required to opt-in again for another 24 hours. Salon confirms that the mining feature does not require an additional download and is not installed on your PC. The mining script also does not access personal files or information while utilizing your PC’s CPU.",

    "detailContent": "  that it plans to use  to give you more control over your digital identity. Alex Simons, director of program management at Microsoft’s Identity Division, says the company invested in incubating a set of ideas relying on blockchain technology over the last 12 months. Monday’s update will be the first of many regarding how Microsoft plans to use that technology to create decentralized identities (DIDs). The word “blockchain” is typically associated with cryptocurrency platforms. In its basic form, a blockchain contains a network of data blocks protected through cryptography. This data doesn’t reside within a central location, nor is it managed by one specific entity. Instead, these data blocks are “chained” between participating PCs scattered across the globe. This data cannot be altered or hacked because all blocks have a cryptographic hash of the previous block along with their transaction data and a timestamp. In a sense, a blockchain is an open, digital ledger that records all transactions, but is not maintained by one party. That is the problem with most if not all internet-connected services: your information and transactions are stored on servers, which can be infiltrated by hackers looking for juicy personal data. Even more, all data written to any given block cannot be altered unless the previous blocks are altered, too. While a blockchain is essential for decentralized transaction recording, it’s also great for storing your personal information. According to Microsoft, a blockchain would eliminate the need to provide “broad consent” to “countless apps and services.” Your identity wouldn’t be duplicated and spread out across multiple providers such as Twitter, , Instagram, Google Play, Amazon, and so on. “Today, apps, services, and organizations deliver convenient, predictable, tailored experiences that depend on control of identity-bound data. We need a secure encrypted digital hub (ID hubs) that can interact with user’s data while honoring user privacy and control,” adds Ankur Patel from Microsoft’s Identity Division. Of course, this isn’t a platform Microsoft can tackle alone. It’s working with individuals and organizations through the  to create an ecosystem that supports decentralized identities. There are four basic components in this initiative: A  specification that defines a Decentralized Identifier, an encrypted identity datastore, a server that revolves DIDs across blockchains, and another W3C-based spec called Verified Credentials. The big goal is to make this blockchain foundation scalable. It needs to expand as devices, organizations, users, and even new technology jumps into the mix without hitting a threshold. Patel says that several blockchain communities will increase block sizes to increase capacity, but this method not only degrades decentralization but cannot handle the transaction of a world-scale platform. That said, the “transactions” aspect doesn’t necessarily mean purchases between entities. The company is likely referring to transactions between your data and services accessing that data. There is a permanent record of what those apps and services use. How you will be able to control those transactions remains to be seen. Microsoft will begin experimenting with blockchains using Authenticator as its test subject.",

    "title": "Plugin Used by Government Sites Across Hacked To Mine Digital Coins | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "  relying on the  plugin developed by U.K.-based Texthelp recently fell prey to a hack that secretly ran a cryptocurrency mining script in the background of visiting PCs. Websites use this specific plugin for visually impaired visitors so they can hear content, but on Sunday, February 11, someone managed to alter the plugin’s code to run Coinhive’s controversial JavaScript-based . Because it’s based on JavaScript, administrators can easily insert  into a webpage. It runs in the background while visitors browse the website, silently mining digital coins using their PC’s processor. The CPU use can be extremely apparent if you know what’s going on, otherwise, the average web surfer may simply shrug off the slow performance as typical Windows or web-based processes slowing down the machine. The mining stops once web surfers leave the offending page. The altered Browsealoud plugin began mining Monero Sunday morning on more than 4,200 websites spanning the globe, including governments, organizations, and schools. Among them was the State of Indiana, the U.S. court information portal, the City University of New York, the U.K.’s National Health Service, the U.K.’s Student Loans Company, and many more. Most websites typically rely on plugins to pull content and tools from third-party developers. These can include translators, shopping baskets and ecommerce, menus, and so on. But the discovery of Coinhive’s miner in Browsealoud points to the possibility that if a hacker could gain access to one plugin for malicious purposes, thousands of websites could suffer. Plugin content typically resides on a remote server and sent to the target web page using a secure connection. The problem is that there is no real system to authenticate the actual content. Thus, someone with access to the content could easily inject malicious code, and the resulting websites using the plugin would serve up the malicious content despite registering the server as secure. One method to fix this problem is called . It comprises of two HTML elements with an “integrity” attribute that relies on a cryptographic hash. If the number provided to the website doesn’t match the number associated by the content, then the website can catch and block the malicious code. Unfortunately, this isn’t a widely used technique, but the recent issue with Browsealoud may convince more websites to utilize the Subresource Integrity method. Coinhive’s miner was reportedly only active in the Browsealoud plugin  before Texthelp pulled the plug. And although the outcome was apparently only to generate digital coin, the company still considers the hack as a criminal act. “Texthelp has in place continuous automated security tests for Browsealoud — these tests detected the modified file and as a result, the product was taken offline,” Texthelp Chief Technical Officer Martin McKay said in a statement. “This removed Browsealoud from all our customer sites immediately, addressing the security risk without our customers having to take any action.” Texthelp is currently working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Agency to hunt down the hacker(s).",

An ICO is a fundraising event where a cryptocurrency sells a percentage of that currency, in the form of tokens, to people in exchange for money to help get the cryptocurrency off the ground. A few words of praise from certain celebrities have helped numerous cryptocurrencies earn millions of dollars in funding. Actors, musicians, athletes, and entrepreneurs have all been drawn to the allure of cryptocurrencies. These are some of the most notable celebrity endorsements. No rapper has benefited from the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies like 50 Cent. In an effort to stay current with how his fans purchase music, 50 Cent  of his 2014 album . He received 700 bitcoins, which were valued at $660 each, at the time, and admits he forgot about the stash. Once each bitcoin’s value exploded in 2017 to a record high of $19,850 in mid-December, his forgotten stash rose in value to as high as nearly $14 million. When 50 celebrated his new fortune in January, the value had dropped to $10,000 per bitcoin, enough for a nearly $8 million haul. Nas was a celebrity endorsing cryptocurrency before it became a fad. He invested in bitcoin  in early 2014. Months later in a , Nas proclaimed that bitcoin had the potential to be “as big, if not bigger, than the Internet.” A few months later, the  rapper informed his  that he would be rewarding bitcoins to those with the highest scores on his Nas trivia contest at  website. At the time of the August 2014 interview, the legendary lyricist claimed he and his team had been collecting bitcoins for over a year, when the price of a bitcoin hovered between $100-$1,000. At the time of press, each bitcoin is worth roughly $8,000, which would net the multi-millionaire rapper a hefty sum of money if he kept a large enough number of bitcoins in his stash. Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder trying to make  a reality, rarely does anything less than epic. His love of cryptocurrency is no different. He invested $30 million into  in 2014. Before that, he announced he would  as a form of payment for tickets on his upcoming commercial space travel service Virgin Galactic, in late 2013. Branson received  for tickets only a few months after that announcement. Later in 2014, the multi-billionaire voiced his immense satisfaction in  in a September 2014 interview. His cryptocurrency support hasn’t wavered over the years, with Branson investing in  last year. The  star has had a complicated, but profitable relationship with technology over the last decade. He portrayed  in a film, and was an early investor in and Uber. One of his early hits was in cryptocurrency, and it’s starting to pay off. Kutcher is one of the earliest celebrities to the cryptocurrency craze,  Ethereum in May 2014, more than a year before its initial release in July 2015. Ethereum is now one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, with one Ethereum valued at more than $830, at the time of press. Kutcher also invested in Bitcoin processing service Bitbay, and regularly updates his 19 million Twitter followers about the latest  news. Back in November 2017, Katy Perry shared with her more than 68 million Instagram followers how she got some cryptocurrency advice from one of the best people to get any financial advice from: . It wasn’t long after her meeting with Buffett that Perry became a cryptocurrency supporter. In January, she posted on Instagram what may be the  to date, embroidering her nails with the logos of five cryptocurrencies. Tweeting about how much you love bitcoin is one thing. Decorating your nails with the logos of five of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world is a different level of crypto dedication. Floyd Mayweather is synonymous with two things – money, and winning. Now, he may be one of the most active celebrity endorsers in the cryptocurrency market. In July 2017, Mayweather endorsed the ICO for . A month later in August 2017, the undefeated pugilist promoted the ICO for a blockchain-based content marketplace known as . Then, in September 2017, Mayweather signed on to being the brand ambassador for . Mayweather’s endorsement is as good as his right jab, with Centra raising more than  weeks after Mayweather’s endorsement. No wonder the revered boxer has referred to himself as “.” DJ Khaled’s greatest talent is promotion. He can make any mundane meetings feel like the Super Bowl with his boisterous personality and grandiose descriptions of everything. Just like Mayweather, Khaled used his social media promotional prowess to endorse the potential of cryptocurrency platform Centra. In September 2017, Khaled bragged to his more than 12 million followers on Twitter and Instagram about having a “ from Centra. A month later in October 2017, he posted a  page showing off the features of Centra Wallet app on his iPhone, a few weeks after the app hit the Apple Store. Unlike most celebrities whose cryptocurrency endorsements don’t extend beyond a few social media posts, Tyson tied Bitcoin directly to his brand. In late 2015, Tyson partnered with  to release Bitcoin ATMs branded with the fighter’s ferocious image. Months later in January 2016, Tyson and Bitcoin Direct announced the former heavyweight champ would get his own  where people can buy and exchange cryptocurrency directly form the app. Jamie Foxx has given a few technology endorsements over the years, including a , and Verizon Wireless. So, it’s not a big surprise that the 50-year old comedian has got in on the cryptocurrency craze. Foxx  in the ICO of cryptocurrency exchange platform Cobinhood to his more than four million followers on Twitter in September 2017. Cobinhood raised nearly mere weeks after Foxx’s endorsement.

After a  soon after its launch, the coin quickly gained footing in the crypto world, and is still being mined and traded. Created by the man who brought us the world’s first  (yes you read that right), this garlic-based cryptocoin definitely ranks high on the list of “weird internet stuff.”. Formerly known as Coinye West, this musician-inspired currency is now (unfortunately) abandoned. Shortly after its inception, the currency came under fire, and was targeted in a lawsuit from Mr. West’s lawyers, who claimed that the coin’s creators illegally used the hip hop star as the currency’s mascot. Based around a blockchain called “Velocity,” Insanecoin might actually be, well, insane. Currently running pretty low, the team behind the coin appears to be giving the coins away in exchange for publicity. As you may have guessed from the name, Unobtanium was intentionally designed to be difficult to get. With pre-launch announcements, and no pre-mining beforehand, Unobtanium pushed for a transparent, fair, and more rare currency, promising a cap of 250,000 coins. Yup. Sexcoin. Designed to be an alternative payment system for the adult entertainment industry, the lewd currency offers a fee-free way to pay for certain purchases and services that you would rather keep on the down-low. Touted as a currency for “Trump Patriots,” Trumpcoin’s mission is to use the brave new world of digital currencies to make our 45th president’s dreams for America come true. Like Trumpcoin, Putincoin is ridiculously patriotic, but with a more socialist flair. Rather than strictly supporting the goals and ideals of Russia’s current leader, the Putincoin’s creators built the coin to support their country, neighbors, and the planet as a whole. The purpose of FUCK Tokens is simple and straightforward. It was created to inspire and empower everyone around the world to “give a FUCK” — literally. Whatever your cause may be, you can now support it by giving an actual fuck. Served with a heaping helping of sass, this currency is a middle finger aimed squarely at the Cryptocurrency craze. When created, the value of each token was zero, promising investors that its value would never fall, because it couldn’t. Amazingly, despite its satirical foundations, the currency still managed to earn a whopping $62,750 during its initial coin offering. In case you haven’t noticed, there are a lot of Ethereum spin-offs — but this one may be the cheekiest of them all. After splitting off from Ethereum and founding, the creators split off again to create Ethereum Classic Classic. Ridiculous. In a list full of silliness and jokes, the Petro is very serious. Announced by Venezuelan president at the end of 2017, the currency will reportedly be backed by the nation’s reserves of oil, gasoline, gold, and diamonds. While the Petro has yet to come into circulation, its creators hope that it will alleviate the current economic turmoil that Venezuela is undergoing as the value of its currency, the Bolivar, plummets. DentaCoin is “The only cryptocurrency for dentists, by dentists.” It sounds ridiculous, but DentaCoin’s goal is pretty noble, actually. It’s intended to improve dental care worldwide by making it affordable through crowd power, as well as creating a secure, traceable system for dental care. Described literally as a ritual to the elder god Cthulhu, the OFF currency speaks of sacrifice, reward, and a strange six month long bounty gifted upon a “chosen one.” This is about as weird as it gets.",

    "detailContent": "   By the numbers, Nvidia had a record-breaking year, with fourth-quarter GAAP-adjusted revenue of $2.91 billion — up 34 percent from last year — and a yearly total of $9.71 billion, a 41-percent increase year on year. AMD earned less, but arguably had the more momentous year. After facing a net income loss of half a billion dollars in 2016, it managed to generate an annual net income of $43 million off of $5.33 billion in total revenue — more than a quarter of which came in during the fourth quarter. While AMD certainly benefitted from a strong consumer response to its Ryzen CPUs in 2017, both it and Nvidia saw enormous interest in its add-in graphics cards. Although gamers and typical holiday demand were responsible in part for the strong  sales for both companies, another driver of sales was cryptocurrency miners. The sheer demand from that market is why gamers have struggled to find reasonably priced  for much of the past year. Neither company has stated  that miners helped with the strong revenue each saw in 2017, but Nvidia’s CFO, Colette Kress, said in  that demand from cryptocurrency miners did exceed all expectations. She also suggested that those sales represented a higher percentage of its revenue than last quarter. Although it’s fair to say that Nvidia can’t keep track of where all of the graphics cards it sells end up, especially when partner retailers make the sales themselves, it . That has seen some restrict the number of  that can be purchased at any one time, but available cards are still  and stock remains very low across the board. There’s no clear end in sight either, even with the . It is important for graphics card makers to get on top of the problem though. As  Edgar Bers, told Digital Trends in a recent interview, miners burning through cards quicker than they would with normal gaming usage could lead to enormous return rates as they seek to exploit lengthy warranties. Another potential issue is that gamers frustrated by an inability to upgrade could turn to consoles instead. That wouldn’t be a total loss for AMD though, as it provides the graphics chips for both the Xbox One and PS4. The Nintendo Switch uses an Nvidia Tegra.",

    "detailContent": " It’s been years since those “Nigerian Prince” scams were popular, as  to the practice of requesting a few hundred dollars in return for a multi-million dollar fortune. But the scam has seen a resurgence on Twitter: Today’s savvy cybercrooks are creating fake celebrity accounts that ask for small cryptocurrency donations in return for the chance to be sent thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins in return. This new trend started gaining traction on February 1 and exploits the growing number of new cryptocurrency owners who jumped on the trend of growing investment in Bitcoin and other altcoins based on blockchain technology at the tail-end of 2017. In this scam, fake accounts pretending to be technology luminaries like Elon Musk or John McAfee promise to send followers as much 20 bitcoins, if only they send them 0.02 bitcoin in return. You can’t go wrong, right? In one example , a scammer was able to trick Twitter users out of 0.184 bitcoins in just a few hours. Considering the investment was only time in creating the account and commenting on a few popular Tweets, that’s quite a quick way to earn around $1,500. According to one researcher from the , much of this is about targeting those who were . They bought high and are now stuck with an investment that hasn’t paid off anywhere near as quickly as they expected. That’s leading to knee-jerk reactions — and scammers are reaping the profits. It’s not just Bitcoin that bad guys are looking to hoover up from opportunistic owners, however. A number of  were picked up as their value spiked in late 2017 too, so some scammers are instead going after altcoin investors with wallets full of  and . But regardless of which cryptocurrency the scammers ask for, the methods are the same. Sure, fake celebrity accounts are nothing new on Twitter, but the use of them to scam users may draw the attention of Twitter faster than most. The question is whether the potentially impending crackdown will be effective; as with the Nigerian Prince scam, this one is profitable and quick to set up. It could take a concerted effort to stop them. Will Twitter help us out?",

Although  may fix that issue in time, in recent months it lead to massive spikes in transaction costs up to as much as $50, making it hard to use for buying things online — drugs included. That’s why sellers on dark web marketplaces have begun opting for swifter currencies with much lower fees. Although a few have been proposed by the wider community of buyers and sellers,  of dark web currencies found that  has proved the most popular. By deep diving 150 of the most popular marketplaces and message boards, it found that around 30 percent of vendors now accept Litecoin as a payment option. Dash is another cryptocurrency that is seeing a big increase in vendor support, with as many as 20 percent of dark web sellers now accepting it on their digital storefronts. Bitcoin Cash was the third-most-popular alternative cryptocurrency available as a payment option, with 13 percent of vendors accepting it. As much as this marks a big change in options for buyers and sellers, Bitcoin is still accepted by 100 percent of sellers, according to Recorded Future. That may be because transaction fees have come down in recent weeks as some of the end-of-2017 Bitcoin furore has died down and smaller transactions are now being processed. Whatever the reason Bitcoin continues to be accepted, though, the faster confirmations and lower fees of altcoins will certainly be attractive. Reducing anxiety related to illegal transactions and speedier completion leading to faster delivery are likely to be major plus points for buyers and sellers. Especially since so many dark web markets have been shut down by the authorities over the years.  believes that the growth in altcoin usage will only continue in 2018, leading to other cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin ultimately becoming the more prominent payment methods on dark web markets.",

That latest bubble eventually burst towards the end of December, with Bitcoin itself reaching near $20,000 per token before the crash. It then tumbled by thousands of dollars in the weeks that followed, dragging most other cryptocurrencies down with it. With Bitcoin now having fallen to less than $7,500, its lowest price point since early November last year, Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup have all banned the use of credit cards for buying Bitcoins. In the U.K., Lloyds group banks have done the same, including Bank of Scotland, Halifax, and MBNA. Although this may stop some banking customers getting into hot water, the move is more to prevent lenders from being hit by this latest crypto-crunch. As , customers overspending in expectation of quick returns could leave banks in the lurch if they can’t repay. Similarly, there is concern over stolen credit cards being used to buy cryptocurrency, which is often hard to twin with its real-life owner.

As , two top U.K. banks, HSBC and Barclays, have confirmed that they are not restricting cryptocurrency investments at all.

He argued that the unscalable markets and difficulty in opening new crypto accounts can make it difficult for the general public to invest in cryptocurrencies. He also added that he felt that many companies got in over their heads by investing in new cryptocurrencies without really understanding the  behind Bitcoin and others. “Yes, there is a new digital gold, a new digital store of value,” Neu-Ner said. “I think bitcoin is the store of value. But the game hasn’t even started yet.” Neu-Ner says that he believes we will soon see a mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies which will lead to a universal store of value. He admits that the market is rather volatile right now, but expects things to start trending upward later this year. “I’m expecting the market to hover here for a little bit, a little bit nervous,” he told CNBC. “And then I’m expecting some kind of something to bring up a green candle, and that will start the momentum back up again.” Despite Neu-Ner’s confidence in Bitcoin, no one can deny that general instability of cryptocurrencies make a lot of people nervous. Over the course of the past week, Bitcoin lost $125 billion in value thanks to a panic set off by fears surrounding stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies. For now, the future of Bitcoin and similar currencies remains up in the air.",

    "detailContent": "   But what if you pit Litecoin vs. Bitcoin? Is one cryptocurrency better than the other everywhere, or do they both have their strengths? In this breakdown, we’ll match the two head to head to see which one you’re best off buyng, whatever you want to use them for. If you’re interested in more cryptocurrency comparisons, check out our and how it . Although making money wasn’t the original idea for cryptocurrencies, that’s what many buyers and sellers use them for, not least because almost all have spiked in value in recent months. Many early owners have made huge amounts of money over the past year. That’s not to say any of it is a guarantee. Cryptocurrencies of all types are notoriously volatile, and have been especially so in recent times. Bitcoin went from being worth around $1,000 at the start of 2017 to close to $20,000 in December, before settling to around $12,000 at the start of 2018. . It rose from just $4 in January 2017 to more than $370 at its peak less than 12 months later. At the time of writing, it’s corrected to $150. This is a pattern that’s been repeated among most cryptocurrencies, however. With Litecoin at least, there is a lot of name recognition. As one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, it’s established and has a longer history than almost all others of retaining its value over time. It’s also supported by a wide array of exchanges, making it easier to . With a growing list of avenues where you can spend Litecoin, it is a more useful cryptocurrency than most. All of the above benefits are also present with Bitcoin. It has the longest proven record of all cryptocurrencies by virtue of being the very first. It’s also accepted at the most outlets, and its support across the globe is strongest. When it comes to name recognition too, there is no denying that Bitcoin is the most visible. For more mainstream audiences, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are synonymous, and with a topic as complicated as this, that seems unlikely to change. Bitcoin is still the best store of value. It’s well recognized, supported by almost all cryptocurrency services, and has a longer history. Litecoin is  when it comes to storing value, however, so it’s a good pick if you’re looking to try out a different currency. Even if Bitcoin is stronger as a way of storing value over time, Litecoin clearly has the edge in transferring wealth as payments and transactions. That shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, as that was the original purpose of the cryptocurrency. Litecoin’s key developer, Charlie Lee, realized that Bitcoin was going to find things difficult when it reached a certain concentration of users. Namely, he saw that transaction fees were going to go up in the future due to fundamental problems with Bitcoin’s design. It’s all about speed. Bitcoin’s block confirmation time is 10 minutes. In comparison, Litecoin’s block time is a quarter of that, with an average of 2.5 minutes. That means Litecoin transactions are confirmed faster, and that in turn means there’s less of a backlog, and fees can be lower. At the time of writing, Litecoin has maintained that average block time of around 2.5 minutes, with transaction costs for those . In comparison,  is just over nine minutes, with the average transaction fee at $8.50. This is a marked improvement over recent times, where fees reached as high as $50 per transaction. Changes being implemented on the Bitcoin network make it unlukunl such fees will return, but it is possible. That’s not to say that Litecoin’s implementation is perfect. There is some debate over whether a faster block time results in a less-secure transaction system, though that hasn’t manifested in any major problems  as of yet. Bitcoin does also have a wider array of purchasable goods and services online, so if you’re looking to buy something with your cryptocurrency, bitcoin does have an edge, even if it’s more expensive. For the time being, Litecoin will be a faster and cheaper way of transacting online, even if there aren’t quite as many outlets available for its usage. With most cryptocurrencies, the question of ‘which is best\u0027(?) isn’t easy to answer. No cryptocurrency is a sure thing and every single one of them has potential and features that the others don’t. The best way to answer that question is to base it on what you want to use it for. In the case of Litecoin vs. Bitcoin, there are two key points that should be looked at. If you are looking to purchase for the long term, Bitcoin is your best bet, and if you’re looking to transfer and spend cryptocurrency on a regular basis, Litecoin is the better option. That should be considered alongside a major caveat, however: Both cryptocurrencies are relatively reliable. Litecoin is a decent store of value in its own right, and Bitcoin isn’t as bad as it once was for transacting online. Indeed if you don’t mind the fees, confirmations aren’t as slow coming as you might imagine, even if Litecoin’s block time is far faster.",

There’s been some attempt by retailers and manufacturers to get graphics cards to gamers, but it feels more like grandstanding than actually solving the problem. The truth is that if you want to go out there and buy a new GPU, it’s going to cost you way more than it should. Over on eBay or Newegg, prices for something like a GTX 1060 with 6GB of GDDR5 range anywhere from $500 to $800. If you want something like a GTX 1080, you’re looking well over a thousand bucks. The best solution to the problem might be to just put a hold on your plans to build a PC. AMD has finally announced plans to ramp up production to address the problem, and Samsung is already planning on developing chips specifically for the purpose of cryptocurrency mining. Finger crossed — the issue might be solved by the end of 2018, but a lot of that depends on the rollercoaster ride of . However, there is another option. We recently reviewed the , a modest desktop PC that looks nothing like a gaming tower. Beneath the surface, our review configuration came with a GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB of GDDR5 that dominated our benchmarks and tests.

Go over and check out the new , which comes the GTX 1060 with 3GB of GDDR5 and the same CPU, but starts at only $750. We haven’t benchmarked the Inspiron yet, but there’s no reason to think it wouldn’t be in the same ballpark. Until Nvidia, AMD, and their various manufacturing partners figure out how to fix this problem, your best bet just might be to check out one of Dell’s new desktop PCs.",

Construction on the data center will begin in April and it will open in August. While it will be used to help Moonlite pursue its ambition of becoming one of the largest cryptocurrency-mining organizations in the world, Moonlite wants to do so using low-cost, sustainable and green energy exclusively. “Our data center, and future data centers, will always make use of 100 percent clean and renewable energy sources, such as energy being generated from hydro, wind, and geothermal sources,” , Moonlite Project’s founder and CEO, told Digital Trends. The site will also benefit from Iceland’s naturally cool climate, which will help eliminate the need for extensive cooling infrastructure. Krige said that the data center will employ some smart tech beyond its use of environmentally friendly means of cooling and generating power. “We will be deploying custom mining software and additional software that is already on the market,” he said. “Our teams will be implementing some smart mining tech as well, including A.I. and custom algorithms to assist in miner management, and to ensure that we are focusing on what is profitable at all times.” The Icelandic data center will, Krige said, be running at a capacity of 15 megawatts, with plans to expand beyond that level. It aims to produce roughly $8 million per month in mined currency. While we’ll wait until it’s all up and running before getting too excited, it’s an intriguing project — and proof that the drive toward using sustainable energy and making serious cryptocurrency bank (hopefully!) don’t have to be mutually exclusive.",

    "detailContent": " Due to the high temperatures created by the hardware used for mining cryptocurrencies, this 36 ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit chips) rig protects its valuable chips by rapidly dispersing the heat. “Having been into mining for a while, we were dreading the arrival of summer as cooling becomes more of an issue than usual, forcing us to build all the cooling systems in our mines to withstand the hottest week of the year,” , one of the brains behind the project, told Digital Trends. “Facing high [capital expenditure] costs for autonomous air-cooled systems, my partner Mirian and I began exploring alternative methods of achieving stable temperatures, taking as a benchmark the cost of a quality automated ventilation system. “Having reviewed numerous immersion-cooled solutions that could be adapted to our needs,” he continued, “we came to the conclusion that the market is oversaturated with high-quality overpriced products that serve a purpose when financially subsidized, but are not viable for mining adaptation due to high costs severely affecting [return-on-investment] periods. That is when we made the decision to create an immersion-cooled solution from the ground up, which will be completely self-sufficient and autonomous from surrounding infrastructure.” The system they built is able to cool up to 72 kilowatts of heat, coming ready with a full fuse box, Ethernet switch, and Zabbix-based monitoring system attached to it. It can be set up in any household or industrial space that meets the power requirements and has running water for keeping the oil appropriately chilled. As Alexander says, the byproduct of this system is hot water, which leaves the plated heat exchanger at a temperature of around 50 degrees — allowing them to heat the surrounding building and even provide enough hot running water to take showers. The setup is located in Russia, where the pair of cryptocurrency masterminds have been working on their innovation lab since leaving previous jobs in the financial sector. “Cryptocurrency revealed to be the perfect platform for an exciting new direction with tremendous potential for growth that provides life-changing digital solutions, so we gathered our savings, converted them into crypto, quit our jobs and never looked back,” Aksenov told us. At present, he said that the pair is working on a brand new immersion-cooled concept, although no further details are ready to be shared. The only thing about this that sucks? That the pair is no longer working in conventional finance. After all, these kind of out-of-the-box thinkers are exactly what the financial system needs. Still, finance’s loss is cryptocurrency’s (and, presumably, this pair’s) gain.",

In the case of bitcoin, it was worth more than $200 billion at the start of 2018, but already that’s fallen to $143 billion at the time of writing. Other cryptocurrencies have been similarly impacted, though Ethereum has managed to remain in the black, despite similarly volatile peaks and troughs. This should all come as no real surprise to long-term cryptocurrency evangelists, as the digital currencies have always been volatile in nature. It was only in 2017 that their value seemed only able to increase. Crashes have happened before, with this latest one spurred by a combination of , as well as ’s announcement that it would no longer support ICO and cryptocurrency advertisements. As , the subpoenas levied against major exchanges Bitfenix and Tether didn’t help either. This latest crash is a big one, though.

However, despite all of the negativity surrounding the flagship cryptocurrency, many in  claim that holding on to your coins is far better than panic selling.

    "detailContent": "   As with other cryptocurrencies, there are different ways to acquire them. You can mine them yourself, but if you want to buy Litecoin, these are the best ways to do so. For those just getting started with buying cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, or for anyone who wants to buy in the most straightforward manner, buying from an exchange is probably the best way to go. Although they are far from perfect, they do a lot of the legwork for you and give you the quickest and easiest access to a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, without you needing to be hands-on for the trade itself. Picking an exchange might seem complicated, but it needn’t be too much of a headache. There are a lot of them out there and as with buying cryptocurrencies in the first place, you want to pick the one that’s right for you. Some of the more established trading platforms include , , and , but  that you can sift through. Whichever one you pick, make sure it’s well-established, has insurance to cover any potential losses — and most importantly in this case — actually supports Litecoin trading. When you’ve locked in which exchange you want to use, your next step should be to sign up. Most exchanges operate from a web address, though some also offer  app compatibility if you prefer. Depending on the exchange, signing up may require you to provide some form of identification, but that’s merely to comply with anti-money laundering laws. You’ll then need to pair your bank account or debit card with the exchange — and in some cases transfer funds directly to your account. Once you’ve done so though, you’re ready to begin trading. The actual method for buying Litecoin will depend very much on the exchange you use, but most of them will boil down to a few simple options. You’ll be looking to make a “buy order.” When you do, a certain amount of your fiat currency (USD, etc.) will be transferred out of your account, with the requisite amount of Litecoin then sent to your exchange wallet. Basic buy orders, sometimes called market orders, make the purchase for you automatically at the best market rate. If you want to only buy at a set price, you can in some cases place a “limit” order instead, which allows you to specify a value. If you plan to hold your Litecoin for a while or have purchased a particularly large amount, we’d recommend you transfer it out of your exchange wallet . Although most established exchanges are well protected, DDOS attacks, busy trading periods, and hacks can cause problems with accessing your cryptocurrency. Making sure you have a firm grasp on it, whether you use a software or digital wallet, is a good idea. The other main way to buy cryptocurrencies of any type is directly from the owners. It’s a little more off-the-grid than exchanges, but ultimately just means that you can have a firmer grasp of price and the timing of the trade. It does mean being actively present for the trade and manually sending the funds, but it also keeps your currency (of all types) away from any platforms which may become inaccessible for whatever reason. Direct trading with Litecoin isn’t as easy  — there just aren’t as many platforms that support it. Fortunately,  for everything from bitcoin, to Litecoin, . It also supports a wide array of payment methods, so you can buy Litecoin with Paypal, gift cards, or a direct bank transfer, among others. To use Cointal, head to the site’s homepage and input either how much USD you’re willing to spend, or how much Litecoin you want to purchase and click the “find an offer,” button. You will then be presented with a list of available offers which you can list by buy/sell or payment method. You can also peruse sellers and look at their reputation, feedback, and location. When you have selected a deal you like the look of, click the “buy” button on the right-hand side and you’ll be taken to the relevant deal page. Double check the details of the transaction and then hit the “Buy Now” button, and you’ll be taken to the login page, at which point — if you haven’t already — you’ll need to make an account. The actual specifics of the transaction will be down to you and the seller, but suffice to say, it will involve you sending them a payment, which will be held in escrow while they send you the Litecoin. When everyone is happy, your new Litecoin will be sent straight to your chosen wallet. The only other way to get hold of Litecoin is to trade it for another cryptocurrency like bitcoin. If you do have some alternative tokens you want to trade, you can use asset exchange websites like  or  for a more automated experience. You can also use Paxful or indeed Cointal, to make direct trades with one cryptocurrency for another. For a full look at that process, check out our guide on  for other cryptocurrencies.",

To clarify, Samsung isn’t making CPUs or GPUs for , instead it is making application-specific integrated circuit or ASIC chips. Think of these as processors designed for one specific purpose, rather than the kind of general use processor inside your computer or . ASIC chips are made with particular uses in mind, and optimized to perform a single task very well and very efficiently. That’s why ASIC chips built for cryptocurrency mining are in such high demand. They get the job done because it’s the only job they’re built for. Samsung getting in on this part of the cryptocurrency craze makes sense, since its a massive company with its snaking tendrils in hundreds of different businesses. Manufacturing ASIC chips for crypto mining isn’t much of a stretch for Samsung’s enormous manufacturing infrastructure. It is, however, big news for other ASIC chip manufacturers. As TechCrunch points out, it’s not clear exactly where Samsung is going to fit into the cryptocurrency chip manufacturing business, but at the very least it’s putting itself in direct competition with some big players in chip manufacturing — namely, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. As the world’s , TSMC has made a comfortable niche in the cryptocurrency-facing ASIC chip market.

The pair embarked upon the project in 2017, announcing an ICO toward the end of the year, according to . The white paper detailing the cryptocurrency asserted that it would bring together the best aspects of capitalism and socialism. “It’s capitalism without the inequality and socialism without the lack of opportunity,” read the document. There were claims that AriseBank had raised some $600 million in funding for the project, and even . However, in the wake of the SEC’s action against the company, it seems that the cryptocurrency has gone down in flames. The SEC ruled that the AriseBank ICO is a securities offering in legal terms and as such, it should have been submitted to the commission ahead of time. It also said the company’s founders made at least two fraudulent claims while marketing the cryptocurrency. AriseBank claimed to be collaborating with a financial technology company called Marqeta to facilitate payments using the Visa network. Marqeta has since denied any knowledge of such an agreement in a . The AriseBank team also professed to have acquired KFMC Bank Holding Company, an FDIC-insured bank, which would allow it to field banking products that other cryptocurrency firms could not. According to the SEC, KFMC is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Now that cryptocurrency is beginning to hit the mainstream, government bodies are starting to pay closer attention. It remains to be seen what sort of effect this will have in the long term, but there are reasons to welcome this expanded oversight. AriseBank seems to have been adopting some shady practices, and we’ve seen various other misdeeds pertaining to cryptocurrency in recent months —  is one way people are abusing the technology.

Facebook claims the policy was designed to be broad, so it might be refined in the future. According to , the goal here is to protect consumers from potential scams, first and foremost. Accommodating potentially hazardous financial service companies isn’t a part of the equation. “We’ve created a new policy that prohibits ads that promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings, and cryptocurrency,” Facebook’s release states. “This policy is intentionally broad while we work to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices, and enforcement will begin to ramp up across our platforms including , Audience Network, and Instagram.” As interest in cryptocurrency skyrockets, it makes sense that Facebook would slam the door on ads that could prey on its users.

The hackers reportedly secured the private key for the wallet, which allowed them access to the NEM coins in question.

The spike of interest enjoyed by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology attracted a huge number of new investors, and that influx of cash has made cryptocurrency exchanges an appealing target for hackers. “In Japan, one of the world’s biggest markets for cryptocurrencies, policymakers have introduced a licensing system to increase oversight of local venues, seeking to avoid a repeat of the Mt.

    "title": "What Is Litecoin? Here\u0027s Everything You Need To Know | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   But what is Litecoin? In a nutshell, it’s a cryptocurrency like many others, built on a similar framework and ideal as bitcoin itself. Created by an ex-Google employee a few years after the first cryptocurrency, it’s now one of the most commonly traded crypto-coins out there, with a market value in the billions. If you’ve heard of Litecoin, you’ve heard of bitcoin and have a , but it never hurts to have a quick refresher. Cryptocurrencies are entirely digital currencies. Think of them as the way you operate your online banking. It’s not a ‘real’ or physical currency, but it can have real value. That currency can be transferred between users all over the world with low fees and far faster than most traditional currencies. One key difference between your online bank account and cryptocurrencies is that they are () entirely decentralized. That is, they aren’t controlled by any one authority. The ‘ledger,’  that records and confirms all transactions as valid is publicly viewable and editable by a large system of users all over the world. In the case of Litecoin, those confirmations are created by a process known as “mining.” That’s a rather complicated topic in its own right, but suffice to say it involves performing complex mathematical calculations with powerful computing hardware. Miners who take part in it also create new Litecoins, which they are rewarded with for performing the service, along with a transaction fee. Those calculations get more and more complicated as time goes on, limiting the influx of new Litecoin. There is also a hard limit of 84 million Litecoin, which means there will come a day where no new tokens are created. Those factors create a scarcity which has helped drive up Litecoin’s value over the years, . Launched in October 2011, just under three years after the debut of its inspiration, bitcoin, Litecoin was created by former Google employee, Charlie Lee. Described by its creator as the , Litecoin is based on the  client. Litecoin was designed to emulate its predecessor, extolling the same virtues of decentralization but with a few key features that arguably make it a more nimble alternative. While bitcoin blocks can only be processed every ten minutes — part of the reason it has experienced longer confirmation times with the recent influx of users — Litecoin reduced that to a targeted 2.5 minutes per block. While that hasn’t always been possible , it is the average that makes transactions faster — and cheaper — to confirm, or validate. The other key difference Lee employed with Litecoin’s creation, was in his choice of hashing algorithm. All cryptocurrency mining employs complicated algorithms. Most are based on the same SHA-256 algorithm that bitcoin uses, but Litecoin leveraged the  instead. Easier to compute, lighter on the workload, it’s what enables the faster confirmation of Litecoin transactions. There is an argument to be made that its enabling of faster transactions is a security issue, since less thorough checks of the data are required, but it hasn’t manifested in an obvious problem in the real world as of yet. These two main differences from bitcoin make Litecoin very much its own cryptocurrency and more than just a pretender to the throne. Over the years it has garnered a base of thousands of owners all over the world, who between them trade millions of dollars worth of Litecoin every day. Although cryptocurrencies (and the blockchain technology it’s built upon) could have serious potential for streamlining a variety of industries around the world — especially when you  — they have two main functions as it stands. The first of those is in transactions. Cryptocurrency, operating in the same manner as traditional, “fiat,” currencies can be used to pay for goods and services. Although cryptocurrencies have a reputation for being used on the darknet for drug transactions and facilitating ransomware attacks, a growing number of legitimate, legal outlets accept Litecoin as legal tender. Whether you’re looking for jewelry, clothing, or even luxury cars, there are . Litecoin is also a great cryptocurrency for giving ‘money’ to friends and family. Due to its shorter block time, fast confirmations and , Litecoin can be transferred to anyone quickly and cheaply if you have . Like some of the other alternative cryptocurrencies out there, interest in Litecoin as a transactional medium has increased in recent months thanks to bitcoin’s value spike and its escalating transaction fees. Although there is no guarantee that Litecoin won’t bump up against such problems itself should it see a large influx of new owners, for now at least it’s a great medium for transferring wealth quickly online. Although cryptocurrencies like Litecoin were originally intended to conduct transactions online, much like traditional currencies, their value does increase and decrease based on a number of market factors. Cryptocurrencies however, with their lack of governmental backing, tend to fluctuate far more — that’s why bitcoin and others have seen such an interest from mainstream investors in recent months. Litecoin too has been on quite the tear and has made many people very wealthy in a relatively short period of time. Like many other cryptocurrencies in the past year, its value has increased exponentially. At the start of 2017 a single Litecoin was worth just $4. At its peak in , correcting to $178 at the time of writing. That’s an enormous increase that shows that just because bitcoins are worth thousands of dollars, that Litecoin can’t also be a great store of value. Some, like its creator, would argue that Litecoin has a greater potential as a cryptocurrency because of its better transactional abilities. While that might not necessarily affect its value directly, it could make it more popular, which in turn creates its own potential for a value increase over time due to demand. When Litecoin was first created, it was just one of a handful of cryptocurrencies. Today it’s one of many — more than 1,300, with more being created every day. While it has greater name-recognition than most cryptocurrencies, its market cap of near $10 billion is far less than the biggest players and individual coins are worth much less too. That shouldn’t put people off it though. It truly shines as a regular transactional medium, with only bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple seeing a greater daily trade volume. There may be leaner coins and some with more advanced features than Litecoin today, but it has firmly cemented itself as one of the most important cryptocurrencies. It might not quite be the silver to bitcoin’s gold anymore, but it is one of the most precious digital metals we have, and it doesn’t seem likely to fall from favor anytime soon.",

Data from the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network shows affected countries include Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain. We have already disclosed our findings to Google,” Trend Micro reports.

When either one kicks in, it would use 80 percent of the affected computer’s CPU resources for the purposes of mining cryptocurrency. “The affected webpage will show the legitimate advertisement while the two web miners covertly perform their task.

Regularly patching and updating software — especially web browsers –can mitigate the impact of cryptocurrency malware and other threats that exploit system vulnerabilities,” Trend Micro recommends. All right, so how can you protect yourselves from this exploit while Google gets it sorted out? Turns out there are a couple things you can do. First, make sure your browser is up to date. You can do that by heading to your preferences and checking for updates in most modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox. Second, run an adblocker on any site that you feel a little uncomfortable about. Lastly, you can always disable JavaScript entirely, but doing so will break a lot of websites and it’s only a good idea if you’re very worried about your security.",

    "title": "Blockchain-based image verification is fighting fraud and fake news | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   He may be skeptical, but he is also hopeful. McGregor is the CEO of , an image authentication company that’s taking a high-tech approach to fighting fraud and fake news. He describes the service as a sort of digital notary for images. It automatically verifies a photo at the point of capture, proving its realness to anyone who views it, be that a claims adjuster, apartment hunter, or someone looking for a date. Truepic is a digital notary for images that adds layers of verification for authenticity. Truepic works through a mobile app — either the company’s own or within one of its client’s apps that incorporates the Truepic SDK — but the real magic happens in the cloud. As McGregor described it, Truepic is essentially running a server side software camera; the camera on your phone is just a “lens.” The server performs a wealth of data analysis on the images it receives, then encodes them to the blockchain to provide an extra layer of security against manipulation. “From the time you press the shutter button, it’s roughly 12 seconds for [the picture] to land on our server, be stamped with server side metadata, complete various computer vision tests, and hash that data and send it to Bitcoin,” McGregor explained. “We are creating an immutable copy of that data that will forever stay true.” When a user takes a picture, it is watermarked with the Truepic logo and given a unique serial number. Each image has a specific verification URL which can only be accessed with that unique number, giving the recipient a way to double check that it is authentic, and not just edited to look like a Truepic verified image. The service uses much more than an image’s embedded metadata to prove authenticity, pulling as much information as possible from a phone’s additional sensors. For example, it doesn’t just rely on GPS to determine location; instead, it uses surrounding Wi-Fi signals and even barometric pressure readings to confirm the GPS position. Truepic also time-stamps images on the server side, so even if someone has tampered with their phone’s clock, the image will show the true time it was taken. Simply being able to trust that a photo was taken where someone says it was can do a lot to combat image fraud. In online dating, for example, this can let you know that the person you’re talking to is actually in your city — and not trying to . A  can integrate Truepic’s SDK and require its members to take a selfie with it to prove their location. (To satisfy privacy concerns, Truepic lets users choose to just show their general area.) A positive side effect is that the time-stamped photo would also prevent people from posing as much younger versions of themselves — a less financially damaging, but perhaps equally annoying type of fraud. Romance scams don’t yield the same total losses as other types of fraud, but they , making it an important problem to solve. The FBI estimates the average damage is in the . “What we saw early on were people taking photos of other photos.” Verifiable date and location stamping may work to combat romance scams, but it can’t solve everything. Insurance fraud presents a tougher challenge. “What we saw early on were people taking photos of other photos,” McGregor said. A Google image search makes it pretty easy to find a photo of, say, a Honda Civic post fender bender, and simply snapping a pic of that photo with your phone is enough to create a “new” image with original metadata. Now you can send off your Inception photo to the insurance company and kick back while you wait for the check. Well, maybe you could have done that — except that Truepic knows if you’re just taking a picture of another picture. While the company is tight-lipped about the specifics of its image recognition technology, McGregor offered a few details about what’s going on under the hood. “We’ve built a number of tests that allow us to understand if the image being captured is of a 2D surface or an actual 3D environment,” he said. “We are able to identify that with a high degree of accuracy.” The FBI attests that combined insurance fraud (not counting health insurance) . But being able to trust that an image is real isn’t just a way for insurance companies to save money by weeding out fraudulent claims — it can also speed up the review process, meaning legitimate claims get paid faster. Long term, premiums should go down, as well, so everyone wins — well, everyone except the fraudsters. Getting its SDK embedded into the apps of major insurance companies is clearly important to Truepic’s bottom line, but there’s a potentially even more critical mission beneath the service. Mounir Ibrahim, Truepic’s VP of strategic initiatives, joined the company after realizing the potential it had to empower citizen journalists, particularly people living in conflict zones. Before Truepic, Ibrahim was previously with the U.S. Department of State, where he served as a diplomat to Syria. He spent a lot of time observing protests in the lead up to the civil war that broke out in 2011. “What I saw throughout my time as a U.S. diplomat, particularly the last couple of years, was a rise in images and videos of the most outrageous atrocities around the world,” he told Digital Trends. “Almost every citizen is becoming their own citizen journalist.” However, the images would often do little to generate the support they deserved. “Other members of the  would undermine these photos on the ground that their authenticity couldn’t be proved,” Ibrahim said. “It was a way to shrug off responsibility.” Essentially, this is the opposite problem to what happens with photos used in fake news stories: Rather than someone believing a fake photo was real, people were choosing, in the absence of proof, to believe a real photo was fake. The cameraphone may have enabled citizen journalists, but it’s all for naught if their stories fall on deaf ears. Ibrahim believes Truepic can provide a solution to this, and the app is already in the hands of NGOs around the world, with a presence in some 100 countries. One limitation here is that Truepic requires photos to be taken on a . For obvious reasons, it can’t be used to verify an image shot on another camera and merely transferred to the phone. This limits its usefulness to professional journalists working with higher end cameras, although they could still use Truepic to at least verify they were where they said they were. That said, it is not outside the realm of possibility that Truepic could be expanded to support other cameras,  and , but this would require bespoke hardware. Photographers would need to connect a device to their cameras that would send unprocessed images straight from the camera to Truepic’s servers at the time of capture. Presumably, such a device would either need to securely integrate with a photographer’s smart phone, or have its own sensors, GPS, and Wi-Fi built-in. Such a solution doesn’t exist yet, but Truepic is at least asking the question of how it can expand to support professional photographers. “The roadmap goes in two directions,” McGregor said. “Across different industries, and across different sensors we can integrate with.” For now, Truepic is providing a glimpse at a more trustworthy future for the internet, one in which we can all be less skeptical about the images we come across.",

    "detailContent": "   The tweet captured the attention Sander Wuyts, a 26-year-old Ph.D. student studying at the University of Antwerp. He requested one of the vials of DNA that Goldman had handed out at the WEF meeting, and once he received it, he set about cracking the code. Working alongside his colleagues, the computational microbiology student used the genome sequencing tools available via his university to make a play for the prize, according to . The process Goldman used to encode the information as a DNA file saw him rewrite a text document in base-3. Using zeroes, ones, and twos, he could map the data to the four nucleobases: Guanine, adenine, cytosine, and thymine. Nine files were encoded, encrypted with a keystream — a random series of characters intended to keep the plaintext message hidden — that was supplied alongside the fragments. When Wuyts successfully decoded the message, he was presented with the key to unlock the digital wallet. Claiming his reward, he found the logo for the European Bioinformatics Institute, a drawing of James Joyce, and one bitcoin.  This bounty was worth around $200 when the task was set, but its value has since . The fact that the challenge would have expired just five days after his victory definitely played into Wuyts hands’ when it comes to the amount of money he’s set to receive. Wuyts will apparently use some of his winnings to thank the colleagues that helped him and will pour the rest back into his research. Meanwhile, the fact that the key was successfully decoded demonstrates how  might be used to great effect. According to Goldman, it’s a particularly safe way to store keys since not everyone has access to sequencing software — and since it takes a matter of days to read the data, it can protect investors against their tendency to sell in a panic.",

    "detailContent": " It’s been a roller coaster few weeks for  and its loyal followers. After reaching a fever pitch in value near $20,000 in late 2017, the cryptocurrency has had a rough 2018, plummeting to just over $11,000 at the time of writing. And now, it’s not only losing value, but it’s losing support from payment companies, too. This week, payment processing service  that it would no longer process bitcoin transactions. The change will take effect in its entirety on April 23, 2018, and in the meantime, Stripe will be “winding down support” and working with affected Stripe users to ensure a smooth transition. The decision, while not altogether surprising, comes as something of a blow to the ailing bitcoin. Stripe was one of the first payment companies to accept bitcoin, beginning its support in 2014. “At Stripe, we’ve long been excited about the possibilities of cryptocurrencies and the experimentation and innovation that’s come with them,” the company noted. “Our  was that bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive.” Unfortunately, it’s become increasingly clear that bitcoin, at least in its current state, has not lived up to those expectations, and as such, a growing number of companies indicated they will not allow for the cryptocurrency to be used on their platforms. Steam, for example, ended support late last year. Much of the problem with bitcoin is associated with its increased value as an asset. Paradoxically, as the currency has become more valuable, it has become less suited for payments. As Stripe noted, “Transaction confirmation times  [and] fees  a great deal,” which has made customers increasingly wary about accepting bitcoin. Indeed, Stripe continued, “Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.” That said, Stripe certainly isn’t bearish on cryptocurrency as a whole. In fact, the payment platform recently suggested that it could consider adding support for the coin Stellar (ironically, causing Stellar’s value to jump ). As the company concluded, “We will continue to pay close attention to the ecosystem and to look for opportunities to help our customers by adding support for cryptocurrencies and new distributed protocols in the future.”",

    "detailContent": " Although bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies have been on the rise in recent years, the boom they saw in 2017 was partly driven by an increase in the number of ICOs. Although that trend has slackened off in the last few months, it has led to a lot of money in fiat and cryptocurrencies being snatched by nefarious attackers. In the report published by , it was suggested that a focus on promotion meant that security was often a secondary consideration and that phishing attacks on the cryptocurrency founders and investors were common. That might involve substituting phony wallet addresses, or stealing login information with phony phishing sites in order to transfer funds improperly. Other attack vectors include denial of service attacks against websites involved in the ICO and attacks on employees and IT infrastructure. In some cases, the real losses come from indirect damage to the cryptocurrency itself. Losing a portion of investor funds could reflect a lack of security with a new offering, thereby damaging the cryptocurrency’s reputation long-term and negatively impacting its value. That can be much more heinous than even hacks of traditional banks.  suggests that the average banking hack is worth around $1.5 million and insurance mitigates the damage. On the other hand, cryptocurrency exchange losses have reached upwards of $2 billion and a lack of reversible transactions and increased anonymity make them extremely attractive to hackers. Just as attractive, however, are the reams of personal data stored on exchanges. Although many do adequately store such information as banking details, Ey Research reports that some don’t, and that information can be just as valuable to potential attackers when sold on the black market. In terms of adequate response, the report isn’t too optimistic. Although it discusses some regulation that has been attempted — especially in cases of potential tax avoidance and money laundering — as we highlighted recently, cryptocurrency . The report suggests that the rate of attacks is increasing, and calls on investors, founders, and regulators to do more to secure funds and private data during ICOs and on exchanges themselves.",

    "title": "How to Trade Bitcoin for Ethereum, LiteCoin and Other Cryptocurrencies | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   If you’ve never purchased bitcoin before or don’t know what this whole cryptocurrency lark is all about, we’d recommend you  to trading some of the less well-known alt-coins. But for those of you who have already  and would rather diversify than invest more, here’s how to trade bitcoin for something else. At the close of 2017, there are hundreds upon hundreds of cryptocurrencies vying to become as popular and , which can make it a little difficult to know what’s what and what you should be trading your bitcoin for. We wouldn’t presume to know the future of which cryptocurrencies will become super valuable and which will fall, especially since they all could go either way and many are dependent on bitcoin in that respect. However, these are some that are perhaps worth considering more than others.  – One of the older bitcoin alternatives, created back in 2011, Litecoin has seen enormous growth in 2017 off the back of bitcoin’s own explosive value spike. It’s increased in value close to 100 times throughout the year, making it one of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies and top five in terms of market cap.  – With a market cap second only to bitcoin itself,  which bundles in features like smart contracts, giving it real potential as a future transactional medium. It’s also seen huge growth as of late, making it a very viable alternative to bitcoin.  – Although some of the experts we’ve spoken to don’t speak too highly of this bitcoin fork, bitcoin cash is, at the time of writing, the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. It has proven extremely volatile, however, jumping tens of percent in days. Be wary of putting too much into this one. Consider it a more high-risk investment than even its brethren currencies.  – Another older cryptocurrency formerly known as Darkcoin, Dash is built on the same framework as bitcoin, but fixes some its glaring issues. It’s a top five cryptocurrency in terms of value, but lacks some of the name recognition of the above contemporaries. Other currencies potentially worth considering are Monero, ZCash, and Ripple, but as with all cryptocurrency investments, do your research first and be aware that very few represent a stable investment. For a look at how all of these currencies are trading at any one time, live trackers like  and  can keep you abreast of the situation. The most automated and hands-off method for trading bitcoin for another cryptocurrency is through an established exchange. There are many exchanges out there and not all of them will tick all of the boxes you’re looking for. Some may not offer trades for the cryptocurrency you are interested in, or provide wallets for that particular currency. For a look at all of the many options available to you,  has a regularly updated list of the best ones available. That said, here are a couple of popular options and the steps you need to take to trade currencies on them. One of the longest-running and most respected exchange platforms,  (its  lets you conduct trades between bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, so you have some choice in what you trade. Since you’ll want an attached wallet, signing up with Coinbase first is a good place to start. Don’t forget to verify your identity and complete the account setup process so that you have full access to all of Coinbase’s features. Once complete, head to GDAX and login using your Coinbase information. You may be asked to verify again, but once that’s complete, you’re in. Transfer the bitcoin you wish to trade to your GDAX account and once confirmed, you’re ready to trade. The main trading page features live trackers for the major currencies traded on the site. It’s a little confusing, but never fear, the actual trading itself is easy enough to get your head around. To choose what you’re trading and what for, click the slashed “Select Product” button in the top left. Select either ETH/BTC or LTC/BTC to make the trade for Ether or Litecoin, for bitcoin, respectively. Next, you need to choose whether you make a standard “market” order at best market price; a “limit” order, which only makes a trade at a specific value or better, or a “stop” order, which will initiate a market order once a certain value has been reached. When you are happy with your choice, click the green “Place Buy Order” button and await the trade. It is unlikely to be instantaneous, but it should be complete within a 24 hour period, especially if you are buying at market value. There are a few more advanced features that you can play with if you want, but they go beyond the scope of this introductory guide.  technically operates as an exchange, though it fits more of a middle ground between something like Coinbase and the more direct trade platforms. That makes it somewhat the best of both worlds, as it’s fast and convenient, but not quite as hands-on as peer to peer trading. It’s also much more private than both, as it needs no accounts or verification and supports far more currencies than Coinbase. The important point to note with ShapeShift though, is that it does not deal in fiat currencies like USD. That means you will need to go somewhere else to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, but it makes it perfect for trading one cryptocurrency for another. Note: ShapeShift does not currently operate in New York or North Korea. To get started with ShapeShift, all you have to do is head to the home page and select the currencies you’re trading to and from — in this instance, pick bitcoin and whatever you want to trade it for. Choose “Quick” for your first time out, though you can play with the “Precise” trades when you’re more accustomed to the service. On the next page, input your “destination address” for your new currency’s wallet (make sure it’s compatible with what you want to receive) and a refund address, should the trade fail for whatever reason. Check the “Miner fee” in the bottom right, to make sure you are happy with the transaction cost, then agree to terms and hit the big “Start transaction” button. The next screen will give you a wallet address to deposit your bitcoin into. Do that and once it’s confirmed, you will receive your new cryptocurrency in its respective account. Although transactions are typically fast on ShapeShift, it, like other exchanges methods, is susceptible to market traffic, so may take longer to make the trade at busier times. Much like when it comes to  or other cryptocurrencies, if you would rather take a more direct role in the sale process, direct trades or peer to peer transfers are preferable. They do require you to be on-hand to make the transaction yourself, but you have a much firmer grasp of the price being negotiated and the eventual time and point of sale. Since direct trades have a set price and you deal directly with your fellow trader, the process is slower and arguably more susceptible to fluctuations in value. That can mean you get a better deal, but it might not. It will be on you to check prices and cryptocurrency values at the point of trade to make sure you’re getting the best deal for you. Although Paxful can be used to trade bitcoins for cash, gift cards, and bank transferred funds, it can also trade one cryptocurrency for another. It supports Litecoin, Dash, Ethereum, and more — check the full list to see if the . To make the trade, you can look for existing buy/sell orders by selecting your currency of choice and chosen payment method and selecting an appropriate trade, or make your own. You’ll need an account to continue from there, but once setup and logged in, you can enter into a direct chat with your respective buyer/seller to complete the transaction. All cryptocurrencies are held in escrow so everyone walks away happy from a trade and it can be completed safely. For those a little uncertain about the process, Paxful offers its own support system to help you if you run into any problems.  is primarily aimed at buying and selling bitcoin, but it does also support Ethereum at the time of writing. It is even more hands-off than Paxful, so be aware that you will be responsible for the whole process, from providing a valid wallet address and completing your end of the deal in a timely manner. To conduct a trade on there, you’ll need to select “Quick Sell” at the top of the page, input the amount you’re looking to trade and where you’re located and then select “Ethereum Altcoin” from the dropdown of available offers. You may not find any listings at the time of searching, in which case using an alternative platform or waiting will be your best bet. However, in the case that you do find someone willing to make the trade, pick the one that offers you the best return on your bitcoin and hit the “Sell” button on the right-hand side. Sign up for an account if you haven’t already and input your trade offer to the buyer. You can then enter a discussion to hash out a deal. Once you’ve made it, await the transfer of Ethereum from your trade partner and when received, send them the bitcoin in return.",

    "detailContent": " Although cryptocurrencies have traditionally had rather volatile values, bitcoin’s has been near unprecedented over the past few months. It went from being worth $1,000 at the start of 2017, to $5,000 in November, to close to $20,000 just over a month later — prompting many to ask whether . It’s since fallen and has fluctuated between $12,000 and $16,000 in the weeks that followed, but today’s dip is the largest we’ve seen in some time. At the time of writing, a single bitcoin is worth around $9,900, representing a fall of nearly $3,000 in the last 24 hours alone. The start of this latest crash took place on Monday, January 15, where it began to tumble from just under $14,000. It’s bounced up and down since then but slowly trended down to the low point of $9,430, . This latest drop has also pulled down some of the other most successful cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, the No. 2 cryptocurrency in the world,  in the last 24 hours, dipping to $870 per ether at the time of writing. Ripple has followed suit, with a near 25 percent correction and litecoin is at its lowest rate in months. Some of this downturn has lead to some sad stories appearing on social media. Those who spent more than they could afford to lose during the December peak are now watching their investments dwindle and disappear. We would always recommend you  before investing anything in something as volatile as cryptocurrencies, and only invest what you can afford to lose. That said, not everyone has lost hope. If you look at segments of the web like the , most simply see this as a great time to invest. Graph comparisons of bitcoin’s rise and fall over the past few years have shown that historic peaks are usually followed by seemingly catastrophic drops in return, only to gradually increase to new heights again in the following months. Considering bitcoin hit a peak of $10,000 at the start of December, few long-term investors are concerned about a return to that still heady value. \r\n",

    "detailContent": "   Even if you’re only just coming to grips with this whole cryptocurrency phenomenon, or have been trading them since the days where they were worth just a few dollars each, bitcoin has been mined for far longer. Its creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the first bitcoin block in its blockchain back in 2009, rewarding him with 50 bitcoins. Earlier this month, miners extracted the 16,800,000th bitcoin, which is significant, because it means there are only 20 percent of all the bitcoin there will ever be to go. The self-imposed scarcity of bitcoin is  it has become so valuable in recent months and proponents of the flagship cryptocurrency believe that that will help propel it to new heights over the next few years. Although there are many detractors of bitcoin, claiming that its scaling issues and ballooning transaction costs make it a difficult cryptocurrency to support long-term, it has proven to be the best store of value of all 1,300-plus coins so far, as per . Other cryptocurrencies that are in vogue, like ethereum, have no cap on their number, meaning that new Ether and similar will be produced as long as people see it as a worthwhile practice to pour their computational cycles into making it. Considering that’s also required for transactions to be completed, it’s important that it continues into the future. As for bitcoin, as the difficulty of mining the last coins continues to increase and the rewards, in turn, are reduced, the rate of new coins being created will continue to slow. Although it’s hard to make any concrete estimations on the eventual date of the last bitcoin being mined due to the unpredictable nature of mining hardware development,  put it as far in the future as the year 2140 — long after all existing investors are gone.

It currently offers quick and affordable money transfers to users on different continents. Ripple’s fees are lower than traditional services and cryptocurrency rivals such as bitcoin, because it employs several middlemen to expedite and simplify the process. The full details of this plan have not yet been revealed, but MoneyGram’s partnership with Ripple highlights the changing nature of money remittance services such as Western Union and MoneyGram. Currently, so-called legacy providers remain a dominant force in this industry, but digital competitors such as Ripple are starting to catch up. One only needs to look at the fate of Blockbuster Video to see the dangers of ignoring the shifts in a changing market. In addition to being faster than traditional services, XRP could also disrupt this industry by being more affordable. Digital-first companies have the competitive advantage of not having to pay as high costs as their brick-and-mortar rivals. They’re able to pass those savings on to consumers making them an attractive option for the money-conscious. The longterm success of this plan remains to be seen, but the short-term has turned out well for both companies. MoneyGram saw its stock rise by 10 percent.

These qualities make it easier for users to trade Ripple for other currencies such as the dollar or bitcoin. Ripple actually began as a -based payment network for banks and other organizations. The coin offers a four-second settlement time compared to the two minutes for Ethereum or over an hour for bitcoin settlements. Currently, more than 100 banks use Ripple’s payment network and more may join soon. Ripple’s unique qualities mean it has attracted the attention of many wealthy investors including Google Ventures though the majority of the coins are owned by the startup’s founders. The cryptocurrency market has been extremely volatile lately with bitcoin, in particular, rising and falling in value at a rapid rate. Ripple appears to be on the upswing, however. Of course, this market has proven itself to be rather unpredictable, so tomorrow could see a new shift in the market though, bitcoin will likely remain on top for the foreseeable future. ",

However, both companies have declined to confirm the rumors. That being said, Ripple, which owns XRP, and Western Union have worked together in the past. In 2015, the two companies worked to develop a program for distributed payment protocols. While the collaboration between Western Union and Ripple could not be confirmed, Ripple’s official Twitter account did send out a tweet saying that three major financial firms intended to make use of XRP in 2018.

In terms of value for a single token, it still trails behind several rivals including Bitcoin Cash, bitcoin and Ethereum. Right now, the coin appears poised to continue its upward trajectory particularly given the volatility of bitcoin. However, it remains to be seen whether or not XRP can become a sustainable alternative to traditonal currencies and money transfers.

It’s no sci-fi fantasy, though. The project has already carried out trial runs in Europe involving 37 different workers and 212 hours of “work.” A follow-up operation is planned for 2018 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The initiative currently involves mining vertcoin and startcoin cryptocurrencies, since these require less energy to mine than bitcoin. At present success rates, it would take one month of heat mining of 44,000 people at present success rates to afford a single bitcoin. Volunteers in the project kept 80 percent of the cryptocurrencies they generated, while the rest was given to IoHO. In terms of efficiency, it’s nowhere close to getting a regular job and working to buy cryptocurrency. However, its creators hope the project’s conceptual nature means that it is about more than just making its participants a quick buck.",

His work at EXMO does not involve access to financial assets and the exchange is currently operating normally. Local news outlets reported that on Boxing Day, six armed men kidnapped Lerner and forced him into a car that was displaying stolen plates. Kiev police later responded to a call concerning a kidnapping in the Obolon district of Kiev, though the police spokesperson refused to reveal the name of the victim. EXMO has expressed gratitude to the media and cryptocurrency community for their support of the company and Lerner during this time. However, it did caution that the kidnapping had spawned various rumors that could impede the work of law enforcement, so the company would not be making any more comments regarding the kidnapping. In regards to the ransom, it is not yet known where it came from. However, the company has promised its users that their wallets and accounts are safe, as Lerner did not have access to them. Regardless, it is likely that the criminals have already sold their bitcoins due to the fact that the market is , and holding onto them for too long could mean a decrease in value. Ukraine authorities told the Guardian that this is the first bitcoin-related kidnapping the country has seen.

Though Faucette’s report, entitled “Bitcoin Decrypted,” did not give an actual value for bitcoin, a section called “Attempts to Value Bitcoin” gave some insight into his thoughts on the currency and why it can be so difficult to determine . The first point that he considered was whether or not bitcoin could be considered a true currency. He concluded that due to the fact that there is no interest rate attached to bitcoin, it could not be considered a true currency the way the dollar or the euro are considered currencies. He did concede that bitcoin shared some similarities with precious materials such as gold, but noted that, unlike gold, bitcoin has no real-world applications. Gold is used in jewelry and electronics, whereas bitcoin exists only as data. That being said, he admitted that the cryptocurrency held some value due to the fact that investors were willing to give it value. He discussed the value of bitcoin as a payment network and conceded that it did hold some value in that regard. However, he also noted there were some limitations to its usefulness. The two issues Faucette cited were the fact that it is a difficult payment network to scale and does not charge a transaction fee. Bitcoin is accepted by a small , but, as Faucette points out with his chart, that number is small and getting smaller over time. “If nobody accepts the technology for payment then the value would be 0,” Faucette said. Of course, bitcoin currently does hold some value solely due to the fact that it can be exchanged for currency. However, the question that Faucette seems to be trying to address is whether or not bitcoin has intrinsic value. Is it truly worth anything or is its value constructed? To an extent, one could argue that fiat currencies such as the dollar hold no intrinsic value, but the faith and full credit of the United States government is still a very real thing, and there is no such institution supporting bitcoin.",

When mainstream publications and those far removed from the deeply complex technological core of cryptocurrencies start talking about investing, the bubble has to be closing in on critical mass. Other fingers have been pointed at the likes of bitcoin cash, an alternative coin that has seen rumors of insider trading swirl about it in recent weeks. Most notably, largescale exchange  of the cryptocurrency just hours after it hit a historic high. No matter who, or what is to blame for this latest downturn though, the fact remains that there are now many struggling to figure out what to do with their swiftly dwindling-in-value cryptocurrency. Bitcoin slumped more than 30 percent in the past couple of days and some of the other most popular alternative coins like litecoin and ethereum have tumbled right along with it, dropping in some cases by as much as 25 percent in the last 24 hours alone. The general consensus among those who have seen this all before though, is to “hodl,” a deliberate misspelling of “hold.” Often also considered as an acronym as “hold on for dear life,” the idea is that these slumps are expected and that  that go beyond a quick cash-grab, means they will soon recover. Indeed, bitcoin has traditionally fallen in value in short periods of time before steadily creeping back upward again. While nobody can predict the future and certainly not when it comes to bitcoin and its contemporaries, there are millions of people involved in their mining, trading and ‘hodling.’ That alone should suggest none of them are about to be worth nothing. It may take time for them to recover, but it’s certainly possible that before long this latest slump will just be one of many on a road to new highs.",

    "detailContent": "   Selfllery generates income by selling those uploaded photos and videos as stock content, while a system based on user activity determines how much a user receives for each like on their photo. A user’s profile rating determines how many you tokens a like is worth, with the scores (and rates) increasing based on the total number of likes, comments, and views across all that user’s content, as well as factors like participating in photo contests and getting top ratings. That means the more active a user is, the more those likes are worth. Unlike a traditional stock photo platform, Selfllery says, users don’t have to wait 30-60 days to actually see their rewards, with you tokens awarded immediately. So what can you actually buy with you tokens? There’s a Selfllery marketplace for users to spend their tokens launching in May 2018 and the platform will be open to any vendors in order to create a variety of options. Users can also choose a percentage to donate to charity. Tokens are also good for participating in photo contests and quests, and in turn, winning one results in even more tokens. Businesses can also use their tokens to take out ads on the platform. You Tokens can also be converted into cash using the Ethereum blockchain, Selfllery says. Selfllery says no prior experience in photography or knowledge of cryptocurrency is required to join. Blockchain technology is used to allow users to see where their tokens are coming from, and to add a layer of security to the system. Selfllery is a 2016 startup and now its social platform is launching in the initial pre-sale form, inviting early users to try the platform with the promise of additional tokens awarded only to early users at the full launch. Registration is open on the Selfllery website and inside the  app, while the  (investor-speak for the launch to early backers) is planned for March.

Today’s social networks have mechanisms in place for users to make money from their online activity, but these mechanisms take time and skill to operate, and in the meantime, the corporations behind these networks are the ones making money from the users’ content.

    "title": "How to Buy Ethereum | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   Proposed as a potential successor to bitcoin in 2014, , offer some interesting features which could make the platform a better transactional medium than some of its contemporaries. Smart contracts make fraud and censorship even less likely than with other cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum blockchain is great for crowdsourced funding that doesn’t require a third-party middle-man like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo. But whether you want to dig into the technicalities of what Ethereum and Ether are, or whether you just want to buy some to make some money out of it, in this guide we’ll walk you through the best ways to do so, so you can get together your own collection of “ETH” in no time at all. Arguably the simplest way to buy your first Ether is through an exchange platform. They do all the hard work of checking prices and making the actual transaction for you. Although Ether differs from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a few ways, using an exchange makes the practice of buying it no different. But which exchange should you choose? There are tens of popular exchange platforms and each of them is a little different from one another. The simplest suggestion is to pick an established and insured exchange with full support for Ether trading like ,  or , but you can always use  to sift through some of the alternatives to pick one that best suits you. Once you’ve picked an exchange, you’ll want to sign up to it. That usually involves verifying your identity, so make sure you have some valid form of I.D. handy. In the cases of some, you’ll be able to twin your bank account or debit/credit card with the site to make purchases, but some will require you to transfer funds directly to a fiat currency (U.S.D etc.) account on the site first. With your real-world money ready to go, it’s time to actually make a purchase. Some sites will offer you more options than others, but for most, you’ll input an amount of Ether you want to buy (or an equivalent amount of fiat currency you’re willing to spend) and click the “Buy” button. If everything goes to plan, your investment funds will be deducted from your account or relevant wallet and your Ether will be transferred into its respective wallet. Although Ether is less susceptible to market congestion than bitcoin, trades aren’t always instantaneous, so if your cryptocurrency doesn’t show up immediately give it some time before starting to worry. Once it does show up, you can , trade it for another cryptocurrency, or even use it for various online transactions. For those more comfortable using their  to conduct financial transactions, there are various smartphone apps for some of the big exchanges, and they can be even more of a smooth experience. Take the same steps as described above but with taps rather than clicks, and you’ll have a stack of readily accessible Ether at your fingertips. If you plan to hold your Ether for an extended period of time, or purchased a lot, you may want to take the extra security step to transfer for your Ether to an account that’s not linked with an exchange. There have been instances of exchanges being hacked or going down during times of extreme trading, so keeping your cryptocurrency in a more secure wallet — possibly even in “ — is a good practice for serious traders. If all of this exchange trading is a little too hands-off for you and you’d rather have more of a say in where your cryptocurrency is coming from, direct trade or peer-to-peer trade sites may be what you’re looking for. They let you set up a trade with a specific seller, but you do need to be present at the time of the trade and conduct the transaction yourself. They’re not particularly complicated, but you’ll want to make sure you double check all of the details before hitting the buy button. Another advantage of direct trades is that you don’t necessarily have to use your bank account to fund the purchase. In the case of sites like LocalEthereum, you can use Paypal, Amazon gift cards, or even cash in person.  that you want to use to buy Ether with, you can also use sites like Paxful to “sell” it for Ether — but for the purpose of this guide, we’ll assume you don’t. In that case, LocalEthereum is your best bet for now, as direct trades with Ether are still a relatively young concept. Head to  and browse through the available offers. There will be a number of different people from all over the world offering Ethereum at various prices, so filter your results by location or payment method to find the deal that’s right for you. Double check the numbers against active trading rates for the cryptocurrency on a site like  or  and if you’re happy, click the respective “Buy” button on the right-hand side. At this point, you’ll need to make an account on the site to continue the purchase, but it’s not a laborious process and doesn’t require the verification often required by exchanges. You’ll then enter into an encrypted conversation with the seller, who will discuss the terms of the deal. When they’re happy, they’ll transfer the Ether into an escrow account. You then make the payment in whatever form you chose, and the Ether will be released into a wallet of your choice. A key component of LocalEthereum is its privacy, so once a transaction is completed, your message history is invalidated by the destruction of your unique, private key. However, if at any point during the transaction one party isn’t happy, an arbitrator can be called in who will be able to view messages at your request. Because it’s peer to peer rather than operating on a large exchange, LocalEthereum and sites like it are far less susceptible to the slowdowns and crashes that occur during heavy trading periods. While Ether transfer times can still be affected, you don’t need to be so concerned about your currencies being locked up in the case the site isn’t accessible. However, if you do decide to perform in-person trades for cash or some other medium, do note that you should take the same kind of precautions as any other trade with a stranger. Meeting in a well-lit, public place is a good idea. Although it’s unlikely you’ll run into problems, you never know the intentions of strangers you met online until the transaction is completed.",

But you don’t have to limit yourself to Dell if you want to buy a computer with bitcoin. You can also head over to  and buy pretty much any computer or computer component you could ever need.

    "detailContent": "   “As we have clearly stated on several occasions, we have nothing to do with cyber-attack and we do not feel a need to respond, on a case-by-case basis, to such absurd allegations of the U.S.,” the spokesperson said. “However, we can never tolerate the U.S. reckless move of using the issue of cyber-attack for the purpose of making direct accusation against our state.” “Crystal clear is the purpose of the U.S. trying to link us to the issue of cyber-attack at this very moment when it is hell-bent on making a harshest ‘sanctions resolution’ against us,” the spokesperson added. On Tuesday, December 19, the United States  to North Korea in a White House briefing presented by counterterrorism adviser Thomas Bossert. The attack originally took place for three days in May across 150 countries using the  cryptoworm, which encrypted Windows-based PCs and demanded  in return. “This was a careless and reckless attack,” he stated. “It affected individuals, industry, governments. And the consequences were beyond economic. The computers affected badly in the UK and their healthcare system put lives at risk, not just money.” The United States isn’t simply throwing out accusations in a heated war of words. Bossert said the White House made its final decision “after careful investigation” backed by evidence, and a unanimous agreement with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Microsoft is even involved,  back to “cyber affiliates” of North Korea’s government. But the DPRK spokesperson said accusations made by the White House are unreasonable. “The U.S., a source of all social evils and a state of global cyber-crimes, is unreasonably accusing the DPRK without any forensic evidence,” the spokesperson said. “This cannot be construed otherwise than an expression of its inveterate repugnance towards the DPRK.” So, what now? First, the briefing is part of a public move to hold North Korea accountable for its actions. Second, the United States will spearhead a plan that will bring the government and corporations closer together, thus increasing the cost for hackers by strengthening the nation’s cyber defenses. Good cooperation between the two entities will bring improved security across the board, Bossert said. During his briefing, Bossert said Microsoft, , and other technology entities already began purging exploits used by North Korea and shutting down accounts used in attacks. They did so on their own without any government nudging, although he gave a special acknowledgment to Microsoft, which addressed exploits prior to the attack that kept many U.S. targets out of the line of fire. “We call today — I call today, and the President calls today, on the private sector to increase its accountability in the cyber realm by taking actions that deny North Korea and the bad actors the ability to launch reckless and disruptive cyber acts,” he said. Most of what he said during the White House briefing made its way into . But the briefing also introduced the nation to , assistant secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security. She will be joined by  and Secretary  to coordinate operations with corporations to beef up cybersecurity on all fronts. As an example of a government/corporate collaboration, Manfra relayed the events that began when  began attacking the Asia-Pacific region. By the end of the first day, all major local internet providers, IT and cybersecurity firms, and more than 30 companies across the nation were providing analytical assistance. This local collaboration between the government and the private sector helped defend the United States against the brunt of the  attack. “In many ways, WannaCry was a defining moment and an inspiring one,” Manfra said. “It demonstrated the tireless commitment of our industry partners, a moment that showed how the government and private sector got it right.” ",

    "title": "Bitcoin Regulation? Nah. Governments Can’t Do a Thing to Stop It | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   Beyond the difficulties presented by the decentralization of bitcoin itself, governments and regulatory bodies have shown they lack understanding of technological topics, and bitcoin is one of the most complex. As governments struggle to ban technologies like Tor and encryption, it seems impossible to imagine them gaining the ability to truly impact bitcoin – and its alt-coin contemporaries – in a way that could impede its progress. The oversight jitters are understandable. There have been some attempts at regulation over the years, and now that bitcoin’s value has spiked to unprecedented new heights, there is greater discussion than ever from governments around the world. Perhaps it’s no wonder that half of those surveyed in a  of bitcoin owners claimed they didn’t want any regulation of cryptocurrency in the coming years. The blockchain it’s built upon does not require an institution to operate it. In December 2013, the Chinese government banned financial institutions from using bitcoin, causing a downturn in the cryptocurrency’s value that would set a precedent for its worth over the coming years. Less than a year later,  had their bank accounts closed. That spurred concern that government oversight limiting access to fiat currency (traditional, ‘real world’ currency) could be lead a wave of future regulations to curtail bitcoin’s growth. Yet loopholes in the crackdown meant many exchanges stayed in business, and bitcoin’s price rose some 25 percent in the 10 days that followed. The U.S. has made localized attempts to regulate specific aspects of bitcoin. New York State requires a “BitLicense” for bitcoin related businesses, with specific rules for employee vetting and identification. Just last month, the  to gain access to information about 14,000 historic Coinbase accounts, in an attempt to gather back taxes from owners. While some of those instances are more concerning than others, none of it has stopped bitcoin’s growth. That reveals the flaws of any future attempts to crack down on bitcoin’s use. There are several key components to bitcoin, and its fellow cryptocurrencies, which make them successful as methods of transaction, and stores of value. They’re easy to transfer, no middle-man is required, and they can’t be linked to owners who don’t want to be identified. These are all big problems for any government wanting to have a greater say in how they operate. Bitcoin is not linked to any territory or financial institution. There are tens of popular exchanges, and even if there weren’t, all you need are wallets and a network connection to be able to conduct bitcoin transactions. The blockchain it’s built upon does not require any one institution to operate it, and indeed is the complete antithesis of such an idea, operating as a public ledger rather than a private one. Without that central location to shut down, any meaningful crackdown would have to be a global endeavor. Even if a country was to somehow prevent bitcoin transactions from taking place within their borders, a simple  or Proxy system would let users operate internationally with little issue. The question is not whether  should be regulated,  but whether it *can* be regulated.  The reality is \u0026quot;No\u0026quot;. The rest is nostalgia. \u0026mdash; Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop)  If governments could effectively stop a peer to peer network, they would’ve shut down the illegal practices of torrent websites over a decade ago. Even the success of the hydra-like torrent sites isn’t a perfect analogy for bitcoin, though, because cryptocurreny’s legal status is far easy to debate. A fairer comparison would be the so-called dark web. Although individual sites, servers and people involved with various activities on there may occasionally be arrested for illegal activities, it would be ridiculous to think any government could regulate the entire network. Trying to ban bitcoin or regulate it in a manner that allows actual oversight would be much the same. It’s impossible on a technical level. Even tracking individual people who own specific wallets is difficult. While the public blockchain might allow governments or law enforcement to track down certain bitcoins, tying them to a real-world person is very difficult. An owner can hide his or her identity with a VPN, , or even physically move a wallet into cold storage (offline) form, making it invisible to the world. Is there any wonder that bitcoin is being used for money laundering, ransomware and other organized crime tactics? Take the additional step to throw your  that jumbles up your bitcoins with many others, and then spits them out into another wallet not linked with the original, and the trail quickly goes cold. The most serious impact regulation could have on bitcoin, is in limiting the ability to “cash out,” converting the cryptocurrency into more traditional, fiet currencies like U.S. Dollars. Making that difficult could cause problems in the short term, though it would need to be a strategy that was enacted all over the world. Almost all global currencies can be traded online without difficulty, so if even one territory still facilitated a trade in cryptocurrency into local denominations, those could then be traded for and cashed out in turn. If Bitcoin itself was regulated against, then users could simply trade it for another currency. If bitcoin itself was regulated against, users could , and then cash that one out instead. With hundreds of cryptocurrencies now in existence and more emerging all the time, it would be nigh on impossible to stop unless all currencies were barred. As regulation in other industries has shown, sweeping legislation is incredibly complicated to implement and even more difficult to enforce. The effectiveness of any such regulation also assumes the need to cash out. Many people see cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as an evolution of existing currency. If we were to reach a point where bitcoin could  of all sorts, why would you need to cash out at all? If that seems farfetched, just consider the fact that hard cash is uncommon in many countries. Digital transactions online and in person preclude the typical need for real-world money. Cryptocurrencies could be the next part of that evolution. Ultimately, the best response to bitcoin is not to limit it, but to embrace the technology and try and work with it. It certainly won’t be easy, as bitcoin doesn’t operate in a manner that makes integrating it with existing financial models easy. As we discussed in a , it’s more like a new version of gold than it is Paypal. Yet it could be both, at some point in the future. Governments like Japan, which now , or Saudi Arabia, which is working on , clearly see the writing on the wall. Bitcoin and its contemporaries are not going anywhere, and any attempt to stop them would be futile. Helping to create the future of cryptocurrencies with the users and developers would be a much smarter and more effective stance for governments and regulatory bodies to take. Here’s hoping they do.",

Bitcoin has had a record-breaking year, and is currently  – something that few would have expected would happen so quickly, given the fact that it hadn’t hit $1,000 as of the beginning of 2017. This is especially pertinent to this theft, as it’s thought that the funds that would have been worth around $7 million at the time would now be valued at around $82.7 million. Digital currency wasn’t the only thing that was stolen in the attack. The hackers also made off with the personal information of over 30,000 users, and apparently demanded a ransom of $5.5 million from the proprietors of Bithumb to ensure that they would delete these records. South Korean authorities have since determined that the company did not do enough to protect its users, given that their private data was unencrypted, according to a report from . The government imposed $55,000 in fines on the firm on December 13. Up until now, digital currencies have not come under scrutiny from South Korea’s financial authorities, but that’s all set to change in the wake of this high-profile situation. This attack could serve as a warning of things to come elsewhere in the world, as criminal activity associated with cryptocurrency seems to be growing in prominence, and various governments seem eager to nip it in the bud.  marketplace Nicehash was recently  that saw almost $64 million worth of cryptocurrency go missing.

    "detailContent": "   These concerns aren’t completely unfounded, as Bitcoin has crashed a few times in the past. According to Dr. Daniele Bianchi, of Warwick Business School, those crashes were due to  from other cryptocurrencies, government intervention, and technological issues. “This tells one simple story; the main risk for Bitcoin comes from external factors such as regulatory intervention and security breaches which might hit the credibility of the entire protocol and its effective usefulness as a method of payment/store of value,” Bianchi told Forbes. In terms of competition, , but so far, the currency has managed to maintain its lead due to the fact that it was one of the first to hit the market. In terms of price per coin, Bitcoin Cash is the second most valuable cryptocurrency at $1,861, though it lags behind both Bitcoin and Etherum in terms of market cap. The recent move by investment firms to set up Bitcoin futures markets have had a . On one hand, the investments are likely one of the reasons the coin’s value has continued to rise over the past month. If we do see Bitcoin break the $20,000 mark before Christmas, it will likely at least partially be thanks to those investors. On the other hand, the  from major investment firms means that we’ll likely see various government agencies taking a closer look at the currency and possibly implementing stricter regulations. Right now, the U.S. government has largely taken a hands-off approach to the coin, but if it continues to grow in value and attracts the attention of Wall Street, it’s unlikely that the federal government will sit idly by. As for the alleged Bitcoin bubble, it remains to be seen what the future holds, though as with many investments, there is potential for a great payoff alongside some pretty high risks.",

Reuters has reported that TD Ameritrade is now getting on the Bitcoin action as well, and will allow its clients to on December 18. The trades will be conducted using the Cboe Futures Exchange. Futures are basically a form of gambling where two or more parties place a bet on the price of the certain item at some point in the future. The concept has been around for more than a 100 years, and is normally handled by professional firms and investors. The winner of the “bet” is then paid either in cash or in the form of the item that is being speculated upon. In the case of Cboe Global Market’s Bitcoin futures, the winner is paid in cash rather than Bitcoins. Those who are interested in getting involved in the Bitcoin futures market should know that, due to the instability of the Bitcoin marketplace, the group is requiring all investors to have at least 44 percent of the settlement price set aside for the bet. This practice is fairly common in future exchanges, but the percentage normally hovers around 10 percent. Instability is certainly one of the biggest fears that investors have regarding Bitcoin. Many believe that the market isn’t mature enough to support futures exchanges, and the price of Bitcoin has experienced some rather rapid fluctuations in recent months. Currently, the coin is valued at over $19,265.26, but it should be noted that it went  before falling back down to the $15,000 range in the recent past.

While there are certainly many economists who caution against investing, and we at Digital Trends would  before doing so, Lendedu’s survey from early November, suggests most existing investors are extremely bullish on bitcoin’s future. Of the 565 bitcoin investors surveyed, all aged 18 or over, 77 percent said that they expect to see returns on bitcoin investment in 2018 exceed those in 2017. To give that some context, that would mean a single bitcoin being worth more than $250,000 by the close of 2018. That would be of surprise to even many of the most ardent bitcoin supporters, with more conservative estimations suggesting bitcoin could reach such figures by 2021.  Still, perhaps that confidence is why a full 40 percent of those polled claimed that they do not plan to sell any bitcoin in 2018. The results were a little more even on that question however, as more than 30 percent said that they would sell in 2018. With projected profits like those expected by the survey participants, you could hardly blame them. Almost three-quarters of those polled by  said they would be looking to increase their investment in bitcoin in 2018 though, so even if some coins are sold, the majority of investors are looking to double down on existing investments. One of the key concerns by a number of bitcoin investors and commenters is whether government regulation could halt bitcoin’s growth in the U.S. and emerging markets. With that in mind, it’s perhaps no surprise that almost half of those surveyed said that did not think the government should regulate bitcoin in 2018.

While Craigslist has never really had any say over what methods of currency are used in buyer and seller transactions, it’s now giving its metaphorical blessing to Bitcoin. If you log into your Craigslist seller account now, you should see a new button that you can check if you’ll accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin in place of cash (or whatever other tender you may choose). The box is located in the “posting details” portion of the seller form, and can be found next to other more innocuous fields like “contact information.” Of course, this is, in a way, Craigslist’s way of passing the buck. Since you can’t actually make transactions Craigslist, having their community use cryptocurrencies could provide the site with a standardized (and for now, trustworthy) method of payment. After all, checks can be canceled, and higher-value items can often be tricky to deal with in cash. But cryptocurrencies could provide a solution. That said, sellers may not be so eager to part with their own Bitcoins, especially since the currency has been doing so well in the last few weeks. A purchase for 0.5 Bitcoins could be worth $8,000 today, but $10,000 tomorrow. Similarly, sellers could also be a bit wary of placing too much stock in this new form of currency — the extremely volatile market has seen Bitcoin lose 40 percent of its value in the course of a single day. But if all that aside, it’s certainly a sign that Craigslist, with its somewhat retro website design, is very much part of the 21st century.",

    "title": "Bitcoin is approaching $20,000. Is it a bubble, or the future of currency? | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   Though it’s a relatively new phenomenon, many claim to know what the future of Bitcoin holds. Despite that confidence, should it be invested in freely? Anyone who remembers the hype train of the dot com bubble will remember too well the dangers of investing in the next big thing. Then again, many of today’s biggest technology giants were spawned in that era, and survived to become billion-dollar companies. Is Bitcoin, like Amazon or Google, on the leading edge of a revolution? Or is it, like Lycos and GeoCities, a good idea doomed by fundamental flaws? Some have theorized the launch of many new alternative currencies –  – have helped push up the value of Bitcoin and other more established currencies, like Ethereum. Ironically, the Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) of new currencies are often funded by existing coins. However, according to host of the , Vortex, that’s only part of the picture. “What’s happening now is reminiscent of the dot com bubble in 1998.” “The ICO craze has died off in the past few months after bitcoin started ripping past $5,000 […] Since Ethereum and most ICOs have little fundamentals, the value would inevitably be driven back into Bitcoin, once people slowly realize how valuable Bitcoin really is.” Ultimately, he said, the main reason for Bitcoin soaring in value throughout 2017 is a growing realization of the potential for cryptocurrencies, the age-old supply and demand, and a better understanding of the digital scarcity that is an intrinsic part of Bitcoin. The way it was designed means that one day, sometime in the next couple of decades, the last coin will be mined, leaving us with a global total of 21 million coins – if we ignore the many . That factor alone could be the reason Bitcoin’s value has surged. The slowing rate of mined coins, and an understanding that new ones will eventually be unavailable, creates scarcity and adds a certain built-in value. The mixture of a distant, but impending end may help drive investment of Bitcoin, but it’s nothing new to business investment in general. “It reminds me of the old internet days,” CEO and founder of , Tariq Alwahedi, told DigitalTrends. “It was something exotic […] What’s happening now is reminiscent of the dot com bubble in 1998, when you saw a huge money flowing into the dot com companies. Yes, there was a bubble that happened, but let’s be frank, what’s happening in the industry today, is that many of those companies that formed during that time are shaping the online industry today.” Alwahedi also drew comparison with booms and busts in the stock market, but he wasn’t sure we’d see a similar crash in Bitcoin’s future. Cryptocurrency has historically risen to new heights, only to crash down again — often severely — before making its way to new record values. He’s not sure that’s something we’ll see in this instance. “I can’t say if it’s a bubble or not, but there is a huge rush towards it. The market is very bullish right now,” he said. “Corrections always can happen, but this is not hype any more. We think this is a fundamental change to the economy, and definitely this will set the scene for the future.” Vortex, on the other hand, sees a correction in the currency as inevitable, but not something that will put much of a dent in its meteoric rise. “Bitcoin’s been on a pretty visible stair step pattern for the second half of this year following a more long-term textbook parabolic trend. There will be pull-backs of course, but they are becoming increasingly short lived as the thousands fly by now, that we’ve surpassed the $10k price point. The dot com bubble at its height was in the trillions, and the crypto market cap is still only roughly $300 billion at the time of this writing. We’ve still got a long way to go.” These two aren’t the only ones with serious confidence about Bitcoin’s (and other currencies’) potential for the future. During a Bitcoin’s most recent tear — itself an astounding spike following an unprecedented year of growth – we’ve seen incredible confidence from some interesting parties. When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bircoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong.  \u0026mdash; John McAfee (@officialmcafee)  John McAfee, known to some as the founder of McAfee anti-virus, and to others as the man who , believes that we could see a single Bitcoin be worth more than a million dollars by 2020. Hedge fund manager and venture capitalist , and expects Bitcoin to break seven figures by 2020. Vortex was a little more conservative in his estimations of Bitcoin’s future, but he sees it as more a question of when Bitcoin will be worth these figures — not if. “If we look at what Bitcoin is truly competing against, which is the gold market amongst many other industries, we can see that the market cap of that is in the trillions,” he said. “If Bitcoin is to fulfil its purpose of being both a store of value and a medium of exchange, it’s market cap must rise to something similar to that of gold, or the U.S. dollar. The limited supply combined with the upcoming halving in 2020 will see to Bitcoin in the six digits by 2021.” For Alwahedi’s part of things, he preferred to suggest that it would grow no matter if corrections happen or not, but wouldn’t be drawn on speculations of true figures. “Are we going to see [Bitcoin value hit] $30,000 [by next year]? I think it’s all possible,” he said. “Nobody would have expected a Bitcoin to move from $600 to $10,000 plus in 1.5 to two years, this is massive growth. Whatever correction will happen will not remain, and it will not drop drastically because the fundamentals are there […] it’s a matter of supply and demand.” Though Bitcoin is important, Alwahedi thinks the real potential with cryptocurrencies is in the alternatives, the so called, “alt-coins.” He means the likes of Dash, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and other advanced cryptocurrencies that offer more than just a store of value and a transactional medium. “Other blockchain currencies that are available, like Ethereum for example, offer a new layer of smart contracts that you can use, and can give you enhanced experiences as well,” he said. “It’s not only about cashless [or] about paying for transactions, but what else can you bring? Can you minimize friction? Can you make it more efficient? Can you make it truly smart?” It’s fair to say that he would say that, considering CrypoBnB’s potential success would be built off the ability for  to find acceptance among the millions of cryptocurrency owners around the world. Yet while the jury might still be out on the potential for niche, industry-specific currencies like his own and , Alwahedi is committed to the idea of smartening up the global economy. In the future he envisions, our money will be able to do much more than just buy things for us, regardless of what currency or cryptocurrency we hold it in. “Bitcoin is a fundamental change to the economy, and definitely this will set the scene for the future.” “I see Ethereum as giving the first insight of smarter currencies than Bitcoin. Bitcoin opened the wide space […] but will it be a smart enough of a currency, or token as other currencies? I don’t know, [but] tomorrow’s money is smarter and will recognize its owner. More than just the financial influence that it has today.” As for Vortex, he’s made his views to clear to Digital Trends in the past — . “Let me be clear. After nine plus years of Bitcoin’s existence, there is absolutely no competition for its main value proposition of being the world’s censorship resistant, permissionless open and global store of value,” he said. Nay-sayers may claim its now too old-school, but he believes the latest and greatest isn’t always the most revolutionary. “We only have one TCP/IP stack,” Vortex noted. “Google,  and Amazon didn’t go out there and each build their own networking protocols, they simply built atop and improved the existing ones […] When everyone speaks the same protocol language, that’s where the emergent innovation can take place anywhere, and everywhere.” With many talking heads suggesting Bitcoin’s latest tear is the sign of an even brighter future, you might be looking to invest. It’s only natural to want to ride the wave when there seems to be so many people making so much money, with a comparatively small investment. It is important, however, to exercise caution, and make sure you know what you’re getting into. “There is a lot of hype happening today, reminding me of the penny share stock market bubble, where people were creating companies and jumping on them because they are cheap and can make lots of money, develop in volume,” Alwahedi told Digital Trends. “Today my advice to everybody is you have to look at the fundamentals of the business itself.” Fees and transaction issues must also be considered.  of the cryptocurrency due to ballooning fees, and its volatile value, and . Unlike your bank account, which is protected by law to guarantee you don’t lose your cash to theft, Bitcoin provides no recourse. Vortex, however, that pitfalls are to be expected, and balanced by cryptocurrencies’ unique ability to solve problems facing today’s investors. “Bitcoin is not Paypal 2.0, nor should it be looked at that way in the short term,” he said. “There’s only so many places people can store their wealth these days, where it cannot be seized by any government or corporation, and thus Bitcoin is becoming more attractive to the people by the day.” Ultimately, he thinks we’ll all be using Bitcoin. “Like the internet, if you don’t have email or a website, the world has passed you buy. So too will be the case with Bitcoin.”",

The authorities have been notified and the company is working on its own investigation into exactly what happened, and the best course of action. Approximately 4,700 bitcoins were stolen, according to the company’s head of marketing Andrej Škraba, who spoke to . Concerns were first raised among users when the website began behaving strangely, at which point NiceHash’s social media presence was the target for a bevy of queries and complaints. “We would not exist without our devoted buyers and miners all around the globe,” read its response to the attack. “We understand that you will have a lot of questions, and we ask for patience and understanding while we investigate the causes and find the appropriate solutions for the future of the service.” It’s easy to see why there’s so much excitement about cryptocurrency, but a situation like this demonstrates what can go wrong. This isn’t tried-and-tested infrastructure, and attacks can and will happen — as we saw with the , unseen vulnerabilities are all-too-common. This isn’t to say that bitcoin or cryptocurrency are inherently dangerous or untrustworthy, but there is certainly an element of risk when it comes to using a service like NiceHash.",

    "detailContent": "   Valve originally introduced Bitcoin purchases on Steam in April 2016, when the value of the cryptocurrency rested at around the $430 mark. It joined the likes of Paypal, credit cards, Steam Wallet, and . While at the time Bitcoin’s value was relatively stable and remained so for much of 2016, the sharp increase in the currency’s value throughout this year has caused Valve to rethink its viability as a payment option. “In the past few months we’ve seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network,” Valve explained in  “Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.” On top of skyrocketing fees for speedy transactions, short-term volatility meant that buyers could see their payments be far higher than necessary by the time they were “confirmed,” by the network, and in the case of a downturn, the payments might be insufficient. In those cases the currency would be returned without the game, but that would incur further transaction charges for the buyer. Because of that Valve has now decided that it is “untenable” to utilize the cryptocurrency as a payment method on its platform, but may consider it again in the future if it becomes more stable over time. For now it seems that if users want to leverage their Bitcoin to purchase games, they will need to cash out first before utilizing that money to pay for the games directly. If all the hype around Bitcoin’s latest surge has you , make sure you read up as much on it as you can first.  will get you started.",

Using machine learning sentiment analysis, and then scraping online marketplaces and social media for news about bitcoin’s changing value, Bitcoin Bubble Burst could turn out to be a savior for anyone getting antsy about their cryptocurrency portfolio. It takes the form of a regular subscription newsletter that collates the information it’s found. If a certain threshold of warning signs is reached, its creators claim it will also allow you to know first — so you can cash in your savings before there’s a run on the virtual bank. “The idea came from discussions we had inside the team about whether the bitcoin bubble will burst soon, or will the value keep rising,” , one of the team members, told Digital Trends. “Since it’s a topic that many people are interested in, we thought it would be good to try and predict the changes before they take place, so that you always stay in the loop.” Hajjaji said that he is personally “optimistic about the future of bitcoin in the long run,” but acknowledged that some other colleagues on the project didn’t entirely share his views. Ultimately, though, he points out that you don’t have to be a bitcoin alarmist or utopian to be interested in setting up an early warning system. Considering that some seriously big investors are getting in on the bitcoin game, it would be silly to assume that major financial players don’t also have access to tools like this. However, if you’re more of an everyday investor — the kind of person who doesn’t have Warren Buffett in your iPhone contacts — it could certainly be worth checking out. Hajjaji said that the team is working to add SMS notifications to its system, as well as considering creating a mobile app to offer live updates. Any other plans to venture into more bubble-related territories? “For now, we will concentrate on bitcoin in particular and see how it goes,” he said. “[But] in the future, we might work on other cryptocurrencies as well, and as our prediction model is getting better with time, we might venture into some other bubbles, too.”",

Now, four years later, Howells’ Bitcoin collection is worth $75 million. Howells told Wired that he has been in touch with the Newport City Council in an attempt to get permission to dig for his old hard drive, but so far, he’s had no luck. “I haven’t actually tried to search for the hard drive yet as I haven’t been given permission to look despite having financial backing in place and engaging the local council a number of times,” Howells wrote. “Digging up a landfill is not as easy as just digging a hole in the ground.” Assuming Howells does get permission to conduct a search, it would be the first dig of its kind authorized in the U.K.  that was not done in conjunction with a criminal investigation. A spokesperson for the City Council said that authorities had been contacted about the dig, but were concerned because such an exercise would cost millions of dollars and could cause a “huge environmental impact on the surrounding area.” Of course, the other major issue here is that there’s no guarantee that the hard drive could be found, or that it will be operational. Howells says that he believes that, as the , the City Council will concede to let him dig. If he does find the working hard drive, he has promised a “nice percentage as a gift or donation.” In the meantime, Howells is keeping an eye on the value of Bitcoin and is monitoring the public address of his account so he knows the Bitcoins have not been transferred. He compared it to seeing your bank account full of millions of dollars that you can’t spend. For now, Howell’s $75 million worth of Bitcoins remains buried beneath hundreds of thousands of tons of garbage.",

The most , but the same market-driven principles can be applied to almost anything. Animated cats, for example. CryptoKitties is developed by Axiom Zen, and it seems it’s taking a humorous approach while still hoping to make blockchain transactions and technology . “Our approach to brand and marketing is, in part, a tongue-in-cheek critique of the ICO market today,” marketing director . It’s proven to be very popular, as the game just launched a few days ago and has already zoomed to the top of all the transactions on the Ethereum network according to the , with more than 10 percent of all trading activity as of this writing. How does it work? Each virtual cat is a unique object or “token” on , and it’s as real as a unit of Ether (ETH, or the unit of currency used on the trading platform). Each one is coded with a 256-bit genome, which includes a set of phenotypes (visible features) and genotypes (genetic features). When two of your little critters breed, their new kitty’s appearance, biography, and traits are the resulting combination of each parent’s attributes, resulting in four billion possible variations.  According to the official site, Generation Zero cats are created by the developers themselves and let loose on the network every fifteen minutes. The gen-zero cats will not be available any more after the end of the year, meaning they will become more valuable. The market for CryptoKitties is already thriving according to the , with almost ten thousand virtual cats changing hands and a top price of nearly 12 thousand dollars. If you’re worried about any , the developers claim that it’s not possible. “The CryptoKitties economy is entirely decentralized and impossible for the development team to manipulate,” technical architect Dieter Shirley said. “Anyone on the team with knowledge of the breeding algorithm is prohibited from playing.” How do you get started? You’ll need a computer with a Chrome browser, some Ethereum to buy your first cats, and the MetaMask wallet app. Who knows, you could even end up with a rare and valuable Fancy Cat such as Chairman Meow, Feline Musk, or Kitty Perry. As it says on the website, “The future is meow.”",

That’s where the majority of the estimated lost horde of cryptocurrency has gone, with many early miners and investors misplacing the currency before it was ever worth anything. As it stands, there are said to be some 5 million Bitcoins that are out of circulation (not actively being traded). According to estimations made by , via , as many as half of those may have gone missing, been lost, or misplaced over the near-nine years that Bitcoin has been active. That works out to around 2.5 million Bitcoins, or just over $20 billion at the time of writing. That is a relatively high estimation of how many of those coins have been lost, with more conservative estimates pegging it at more like 30 percent, or around 1.5 million Bitcoins. But that would still work out to just under $13 billion. A further million coins are said to be lost, due to them being the original Bitcoins that pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto mined before disappearing. Although it’s always possible that he will re-emerge and claim his fortune, it seems more likely at this stage that his $8 billion-plus fortune will remain untouched. Chainalysis also estimates that some two percent of all Bitcoins traded throughout 2017 so far were lost, too. That accounts for a billion dollars’ worth of the currency.

There are indeed some issues with comparing Bitcoin to traditional corporations, but it does highlight just how much the cryptocurrency has grown in recent years. , Bitcoin’s status as the most prominent cryptocurrency in the world was never in doubt. It has faced some challenges in 2017, most notably the  hard fork, and a recent shuttering of Bitcoin trading in China. But that appears to have done little to stymie Bitcoin’s growth. At the start of 2017, a single Bitcoin would have cost you just over $1,000 — quite high, actually, considering it was less than half that amount the previous year. But that peak proved to be just the start of the currency’s latest boom, with explosive interest sending it to new heights within months. If there have been so many problems with the currency this year though, why the latest bubble?  believes it could be Bitcoin’s use as a foundation for the initial coin offerings (ICO) of new cryptocurrencies. While buying a new currency with real-world money isn’t easy, Bitcoin’s intrinsic ease of transfer means it’s a great interim medium for transactions with new coins.  in order to buy newer coins only serves to drive up its value. With a myriad of different cryptocurrencies now in use around the world — including one  — there’s plenty of investment in Bitcoin to be had as a secondary aspect of their ICOs. Anyone who has looked at Bitcoin’s history will expect a bursting of this current bubble, though. Traditionally, Bitcoin value rises amid new interest, reaching new heights only to crash down again shortly after as confidence waivers, before gradually making its way back up again. Although it’s never a guarantee and great caution should be taken if investing heavily in something as volatile as Bitcoin, its rises and falls in value have become more predictable as time goes on.

Still, of the 564 American Bitcoin investors that Lendedu surveyed, most of them are in it to make money, rather than use the cryptocurrency to buy anything. , 22 percent said that they saw  option similar to gold or silver. 41 percent claimed that they believed it was a “world changing” technology and that they were on the cusp of a new generation of payment platforms. Only eight percent of those surveyed claimed they used Bitcoin to purchase something. Another interesting element in the survey was the question of how long people planned to retain their investment. Considering Bitcoin value has increased sevenfold in 2017 but has suffered minor dips along the way, a longer investment makes sense. Still, some 16 percent claimed that they would hold their Bitcoin for less than a year. The most common segment of those polled was the one-to-three-year crowd, who made up just under 40 percent of the total. Some 12 percent however, claimed they would be holding on to their Bitcoin for more than 10 years, which suggests a really long-term outlook for some investors. The average value of surveyed investor’s Bitcoin was $2,930, or around 0.45 Bitcoins. For many that’s a collection built up over time, too, with close to 70 percent of those surveyed having never sold any Bitcoin. Considering the average value of most investors Bitcoin wallets, that would suggest that a majority got into the market recently, as even tapping into the market a couple of years ago would have seen greater returns on investment of comparatively little capital. For Bitcoin to become as mainstream as many backers hope it will though, it will need to become accepted by more financial institutions. It appears that some investors will be helping it along in that respect, as some 64 percent of those surveyed claimed they had, or intended to, inform the IRS of their involvement with Bitcoin.",

It’s meant to be an alternative payment method for visitors: mine coins for the site in return for free downloads, ad-free video streaming, in-game items, and so on. But in a report provided by independent security researcher Willem de Groot, he found at least 2,496 online stores running CoinHive in the background. Even more, 80 percent of these online shops were likely not running the mining software on purpose, as he discovered they were also infected with malware that steals payment information during transactions, also known as “payment skimming.” Groot also notes that out of the 2,496 infected ecommerce sites, 85 percent were linked to a mere two CoinHive accounts, and the remaining 15 percent were connected to multiple unique accounts linked to the ecommerce companies.  that the bulk of the infected sites are running outdated ecommerce software with well-known software vulnerabilities, enabling hackers to inject these sites with CoinHive and payment skimming malware. At the time of this post, one “infected” website was Subaru’s online shop in Australia. Sure enough, when we visited the site, the tab in  began using 45 percent of our CPU, waking up the chip’s cooling fan. Once we exited the page, the tab’s CPU usage dropped back down to near zero, and the fan went quiet. We didn’t find any reference to CoinHive in the site’s source code, but rather a hidden “” that loads up a page labeled “Apache2 Debian Default Page.” The CoinHive JavaScript resides towards the end of the page’s code so it’s not blatantly visible on Subaru’s website. There’s also something definitely going on at Musicas.cc. When we visited the site, the Chrome browser tab shot up to nearly 90 percent of CPU usage. We also found the CoinHive JavaScript listed at the end of the page’s source code, verifying that it is indeed mining virtual coins in the background without any warning on the site’s main page. “Some sites bluntly include the official coinhive.js file, others are more stealthy,” he reports. “Others disguise as Sucuri Firewall.” To prevent sites from hijacking your processor for digital coin mining, you can use stand-alone software with a built-in ad-blocker, or install a similar plugin within the browser.

    "detailContent": "   Of all the cryptocurrencies released in the years since  and its “fuel,” Ether, has proved to be one of the most popular and impactful. Unfortunately, just like other currencies, it’s not without its problems. That latest is a bug with multi-signature wallets, that require multiple-user approval to sign a transaction. Although those sorts of accounts and transactions are designed to be more secure and allow for , a bug allowed someone to become part of every multi-signature wallet that was created since July 20. That means that without that person’s approval, none of the currency can be transferred out of affected wallets, locking up hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency Fortunately the bug ‘only’ affected those new wallets, but considering that many wallets were recently created to take advantage of the new Parity Wallet library system deployed on that date, its reach has proved to be broad and deep. It does appear though, that the bug was not triggered maliciously. As , the problem was exacerbated when the person who triggered the bug went ahead and  which had a controlling stake in so many, leaving the currencies effectively frozen. While Parity claims to still be investigating the issue with no timeframe of if or when the bug may be fixed,  what appears to be a conversation with the person responsible for causing the problem in the first place. They claim to be relatively new to Ethereum and made the mistake without knowing what they were doing. If you’re excited by the recent uptick in value of Bitcoin and other currencies and are considering investing, make sure to do your reading first so you know what you’re getting into. Our  would be a good place to start.",

    "detailContent": "   As a result, the total market value of all cryptocurrencies hit $189 billion for the first time, according to . Bitcoin alone comprises some $121 billion of that amount. Not only is the value of the cryptocurrency surging, but so too is the needed to “mine” these “coins.” In fact, as per an index from cryptocurrency analyst Alex de Vries, otherwise known as , Bitcoin miners could use more than 24 terrawatt-hours of electricity every year to mine more Bitcoins. How much energy is that? About the same amount that the country of Nigeria (which has 186 million people) goes through in a year. To put it differently, this means that miners use 215 kilowatt-hours of energy for every single Bitcoin transaction. And given that the average household in the U.S. uses about , each Bitcoin transfer effectively requires the same amount of energy to comfortably  and all its appliances for about a week. In fact, at any given time, it’s now suggested that bitcoin miners are using enough electricity to run about 2.26 American homes. Bitcoin has been surging over the last several months. The value of the cryptocurrency passed $4,000 in August, then broke the $6,000 mark in October. It’s an incredibly exciting time for investors, but the question is when this upward motion will begin to tail off. We’ve seen various different competitors enter the arena, from promising alternatives like Ether, to forks of Bitcoin like . Despite this, Bitcoin remains bullish, thanks in no small part to the fact that it is a known quantity. Cryptocurrency is still a very new concept and it has yet to reach the mainstream in any significant sense. Some retailers are starting to accept Bitcoin but they are still in the minority at this point in time. Since Bitcoin is seemingly on the up-and-up, and shows no signs of slowing down, it might be tempting to try to get in while the going is good. However, it’s far from a safe bet. It’s still very difficult to project what the future might have in store. There are big questions to be asked about the legal status of Bitcoin as well. The cryptocurrency is founded on a decentralized platform, which could be undercut if governments start to introduce restrictive legislation. And its value could potentially fall just as quickly as it has risen if key markets enforce new regulations that affect its usage — and since the field has become very crowded, a rival coin could perhaps take its place at the top of the tree. Still, it seems that the Bitcoin success story is set to continue, at least for the time being. It’s probably too late to get started as a miner unless you have a high-spec system that is not being used for anything else, but if you bought in years ago when cryptocurrency was still a novelty, you might have a significant return waiting for you.

    "detailContent": "   Many websites now unknowingly containin code which will secretly use a visitor’s computer to mine cryptocurrencies. The code is usually written in Javascript and inserted into sites which employ poor security or have fallen victim to software bugs. In October, it was found that hundreds of websites were hosting code written by Coin-Hive, which allows the websites to generate Monero coins by taking advantage of the processing power of computers that visited the site. Some of the sites had added the Coin-Hive code themselves, but others had been hacked. In total, roughly 150 domains were found to be hosting the Coin-Hive code. The code was most commonly found on porn, file-sharing, and video sites. It’s important to keep in mind that most  do not consider in-browser mining to be malicious in and of itself, but in this case, many of these sites don’t ask the user’s permission beforehand. While Coin-Hive is one of the larger examples of such code, there are plenty of knock-offs, including some which work on mobile devices. Such code will often rapidly drain a ’s battery, as mining cryptocurrency requires a lot of power. Many of these programs are also targeting popular content-management systems such as WordPress.

    "detailContent": "   The so-called “Harvest” project involves using a small 700W wind turbine that’s attached to a robust tripod and tethered to the ground in a windy location. This charges two large interconnected 12V batteries, each in a case of their own. Drawing from those batteries is the Harvest cryptocurrency mining rig in the form of a water- and insect-proof case complete with thermal exhaust, air intakes and a lot of hardware. “Connected to the internet via a 4G USB stick, the rig mines the cryptocurrency  using a high-end GPU (Graphical Processing Unit), the rewards of which are paid into a cryptographically secured wallet over a  (Virtual Private Network),” Oliver told Digital Trends. “Rather than mining all alone, it does so on a ‘mining pool’, a way for individual miners to share their processing power over a network, the rewards of which are split equally based on the amount of mining work done. As the Harvest rig mines day in and out, a weather sensor and  monitor the site, reporting to a publicly accessible monitoring console and dashboard. If wind speeds drop below a certain minimum, mining is paused so that the batteries aren’t drained faster than they can be charged. Then, once sufficient wind energy is available again, the miner resumes its work.” Oliver said he first had the idea for the Harvest project back in 2013, when he realized that the costs involved with mining on grid power would soon become so expensive most would barely make ends meet unless operating on a large scale. This led to him considering using alternate sources of energy and, due to his home in Northern Europe not receiving enough regular sun to make solar viable, decided on wind energy instead. Harvest was then commissioned as a work of high tech art (currently on display in Sweden), although Oliver says the idea could also work practically. “It’s very much my intention to see this scale right up, both as mass-produced inexpensive single nodes for scattering about the windiest parts of the world, and as ‘farms’ of such rigs that feed off pre-existent large 250W+ wind turbines,” Oliver said.",

    "detailContent": "   “Raising funds through ICOs seem to be on the rise globally, and our assessment is that ICOs are increasing in South Korea as well,” south Korea’s FSC vice chairman Kim Yong-beom said said in a statement following a meeting with South Korea’s finance ministry, the Bank of Korea, and the National Tax Service. Should individuals or financial institutions choose to ignore this warning, the regulator threatened “stern penalties” as a result. There’s no word yet as to the nature of these penalties. The chairman added, “There is a situation where money has been flooded into an unproductive and speculative direction.” China’s decision to ban ICOs at the beginning of September resulted in a crash in ‘ values (though  and Ethereum both seem to have largely recovered). That said, now that yet another country is showing wariness towards the virtual currency, yet another crash might be on the horizon. So why are countries looking to ban these offerings in the first place? In essence, it seems like a rather easy way to cheat investors out of money. Rather than giving investors shares, ICOs reward backers with some form of digital token. But as  notes, “There are huge risks here, as many of the startups launching ICOs are getting regular people to buy into thin or implausible business plans—or, worse, outright .” In the U.S., regulators are also looking into stricter guidelines, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pledged further scrutiny (but no ban as of yet). Cryptocurrencies have had a tumultuous history despite their relatively short time on the market.

    "title": "Forget Apple Pay, Sirin Labs Finney Phone Uses Cryptocurrencies | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   What does this actually mean? The Finney devices aren’t made for the, “Instagram generation,” but for people who are into cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and require the highest security to store the coins, P2P sharing systems for payment, and encrypted communication tools. In case you’re wondering, the name is a homage to computer scientist , who received the world’s first Bitcoin transaction. When asked to explain further, Sirin Labs CMO Nimrod May told Digital Trends: “This particular line of devices is aimed at the existing cryptocurrency community, [which] is heavily vested in and passionate about the propagation of the space and blockchain-based products and services it can bring about.” Surely, you may ask, this is an incredibly niche market? May’s answer: “You’re absolutely right, most people haven’t heard of cryptocurrencies, but the team is betting heavily that the future will be cryptocurrency based. This is an early adopter community — for now — but we believe there is a large market opportunity right behind them.” Let’s say you’re part of the crypto crowd; what does Finney offer? It’s two devices. A $1,000  and an $800 computer, both of which run a forked version of  called Shield OS and Sirin Labs Cyber Protection Suite. Here’s a taste of what makes that special for anyone who understands cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology: Secure P2P sharing, built-in crypto wallet, tamper proof verification, secure text and emails, biometric authentication, and a behavioral-based Intrusion Prevention System to stop device attacks. If some of this sounds familiar, it’s because Sirin Labs has taken security features used in the Solarin phone, adapted them for Finney, and repackaged it for use with cryptocurrencies. The phone has a 5.2-inch screen with a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution, 8GB of , 256GB of internal storage, a 16-megapixel rear camera, and a 12-megapixel wide-angle selfie camera. Sirin Labs hasn’t listed the processor, and didn’t answer our question on which one the phone will use. In the promotional render above, the Finney phone has an almost bezel-less screen, making it look very modern, and certainly considerably more attractive than the Solarin. The accompanying all-in-one computer is also a mystery, including how it will connect to the phone. A system similar to  is possible, but that is speculation on our part. While the Solarin phone was available to buy soon after its launch, Sirin Labs is going down the crowdfunding route for Finney. It has not stated which platform will be used for crowdfunding, or when the devices are expected to be released. When Digital Trends asked to see the Finney devices, we were told it was too early for prototypes, so don’t expect it to be in the immediate future. Also, don’t expect to use cash or a credit card to buy the Finney devices. You’ll need SRN tokens, which will be the default currency on the Finney blockchain network. We’ll assume SRN is Sirin Labs own cryptocurrency, and it’s likely through this that the company is banking on long-term success, rather than sales from the actual devices.",

    "title": "Dentacoin Wants To Be Bitcoin For Teeth, But It’s A Bit Absurd | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   Yes, that’s right. It’s cryptocurrency for your teeth. Called Dentacoin, it pitches itself as a way to improve dental health, cut out insurance companies as middle men, and foster cooperation between dentists and patients. But can a currency with so specific a role possibly hope to compete in a space with 700+ other crypto coins, including the , Bitcoin? If your response to that question was a huff of derision, you’re not alone. A cryptocurrency used exclusively to pay your dentist seems rather ridiculous, and it goes against the broad goal of ‘digital cash’ that most cryptocurrencies aim for. Why would you trade real world money, which can be used to pay for anything, for something that can only be used for dental care? Your laughter would be met with a stony – if well maintained – smile from Dentacoin’s founders, and its associated foundation. Highlighting the blockchain’s ability to offer a decentralized infrastructure that is free from political pressure and regulatory interference, they believe that  for all. That’s a big claim for a system that gives you some money back on your next scale and polish, but its proponents claim that the immediate benefits of Dentacoin are simple and direct.  Dentistry patients will be rewarded Dentacoins for taking part in surveys and reviews of dental practices and procedures, which they can then use to pay for future treatments or dental products. In return, those dental practices receive detailed feedback from their customers, and can use that information for market research purposes. It sounds more like a supermarket reward point system. On top of that, the blockchain itself can operate as a  between patients and practices, ensuring that the public can see who is paying who for what services. In other words, Dentacoin wants to combine paid surveys with an unalterable review platform. While it’s leveraging new technologies to complete this, the core concept seems less than revolutionary. Indeed, , or a gift card. Why couldn’t a dentist just have its own reward card complete with tooth stamps for a free checkup? Although the blockchain system’s ability to identify a ‘verified customer’ does offer more concrete proof of real patients leaving reviews, customer feedback is not impossible to find as it is, and there’s no sign that fraudulent reviews are an industry problem. While pitched as a benefit to patients, it looks as though paranoid dentists are the true target audience. According to Dentacoin’s backers, as many as 6,000 people are already making use of the Dentacoin system – but only two dental practices in Europe accept it as a currency. You could be sitting on a Dentacoin gold mine, and the best you could hope for is a choice of two practices, very likely located on another continent. Although the chicken and egg problem is pervasive in all new technological platforms and services, it seems to be a fatal flaw of this already limited system. There’s also the issue of where the monetary value in Dentacoin comes from. A closed loop financial system is only as good as its users’ ability to cash out, to trade it for real money in both directions. Dentacoin makes that difficult.  Any disruption in trust will undermine that. For now, Dentacoins are centrally produced and controlled, to ensure they’re given out fairly. Where it becomes more difficult to justify is years down the line, when stockpiles of Dentacoins have been created at various tooth drillers. The  that at that point, the dentists themselves can then reward patients for surveys and feedback with those tokens. How can a review system possibly operate fairly, when it will rely on the companies being reviewed to, effectively, ? Worse, the currency is likely to be volatile. As we have seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum, many factors outside the market itself  on a cryptocurrency’s implicit value, which could destroy collections overnight, or create potential Dentacoin millionaires – who would then have few avenues for spending the currency. There’s a limit to how many cavities you need filled. These problems are only a concern if the coin becomes popular, and most believe it won’t even come close to achieving. As host of the , Vortex, told DigitalTrends, altcoins like Dentacoin “do not have the capability to scale to global audiences because blockchains are inherently slow and expensive despite the extraordinary claims made by these founders.” A lack of market share only enhances a cryptocurrency’s volatility, which in turn makes it susceptible to the influences of individuals and small groups. Big investments or sales of the coin would lead to huge changes in its value, making it dangerous for investors, and ripe for exploitation. “None of these app coins have enough market share to provide any real liquidity.” “None of these app coins currently have enough market share to provide any real liquidity for proper investors,” Vortex said. Their books are razor thin, so anyone can come along and either pump or dump the market price very easily, which leaves the chain quite open to attacks and manipulation.” Dentacoin’s existence underscores the difficulties that still face cryptocurrency’s efforts to gain mainstream legitimacy, yet also shows why investors have flocked to the original digital coin – Bitcoin. Stability matters, and struggling alternatives like Dentacoin only underscore that fact. At best, Dentacoin is a misguided attempt to leverage a vogue technology to over complicate systems already in place. At worst, it could wipe the smile off the face of naive investors – and patients.",

    "detailContent": "   The price of Bitcoin has a history of rising to new highs, crashing in the aftermath of reduced confidence, and then slowly building up to even greater highs. That pattern is evident if you look at multiple year graphs of the cryptocurrency’s value, and was highlighted in our recent chat with a few experts about . This latest peak is astronomically high, though. It’s more than twice the value the currency held in mid-May and . It’s rising so quickly in fact, that we’ve updated that total twice just while writing this story. That rise has pushed Bitcoin’s market cap to $70.6 billion, which is tens of billions more than it was a mere few months ago. This is perhaps more impressive since there was some consideration earlier this month that Bitcoin could become the lesser of two currencies, after a “hard fork,” saw the creation of “Bitcoin Cash.” Although essentially merely an alternative, or “altcoin” much like many other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash was the first to attempt to use the recognizable name of Bitcoin for its nomenclature. Despite its promises to deliver a more consumer friendly experience than its parent though, Bitcoin Cash has fallen from its $640 peak to $300 per unit at the time of writing. Although it’s possible that Bitcoin Cash will gather more steam in the future, for now it’s Bitcoin, not its young upstart, that is seeing monumental growth, more than eight years on from its debut. One other cryptocurrency that is in vogue, Ether, has also recovered from its valuation tumble in late July.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Challengers Are Many, But It Remains The Most Important Cryptocurrency | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   The success of Bitcoin has inspired many imitators. That includes the classics, like Litecoin and Dogecoin, along with more contemporary and serious alternatives, like Ethereum and Zcash. They’re all subtly different, and often more volatile, than their Bitcoin foundation. There’s now more than 900 cryptocurrencies in the wild. While many of them hog attention with their potential for larger earnings on less upfront investment, differing features, or philosophy, their futures still rest in the hands of that cryptocurrency created way back in 2009. They are all built off the same core technology as Bitcoin, and susceptible to the same whims of human nature. “Bitcoin underpins and backs up the entire crypto economy. When Bitcoin falls, the rest fall, when Bitcoin rises, the rest rise,” the host of the , Vortex, told Digital Trends. “The alt coins are simply an extension of Bitcoin, most of them are even based on its source code.” “Nothing like bitcoin could ever emerge again as the path to its inception is absolutely unique.” There’s many “alt coins,” most with a unique spin. Some use different cryptographic hash functions, others build in smart contracting functionality, while others look to be more centralized. Yet at their core, they are all built around similar technology to Bitcoin, which is partly why their pasts and futures have been, and are, so dependent on the first mainstream cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin will remain the digital gold that backs up the entire crypto-economy,” Vortex told us. “Nothing like bitcoin could ever emerge again as the path to its inception is absolutely unique. It was created anonymously with no pre-mine, no intent for profit, no attachment to any corporation, and essentially donated to the community by its founder.” Although there have been some stumbling blocks over the years, with minor changes required to keep Bitcoin functioning as it should, it’s organic growth, and the lack of a desire to drive profit for its creators, that make Bitcoin so unique. A quick look at the value charts shows that Bitcoin is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. Its value was, at the time this article was published, four times greater than the nearest competition. That suggests a confidence in the long-standing currency that is far grander than its contemporaries. Part of that comes from its very value, which makes large fluctuations in its worth less likely. It’s a sturdier investment than many other currencies – though that doesn’t mean it isn’t susceptible to fluctuation. Its price today is close to double what it was at the start of the year. Bitcoin also acts as the face of the industry. It’s the original, most publicized, and close to a household name. That means first time investors are likely to consider it over other, more obscure investments. In turn, this popularity gives Bitcoin influence over its competitors. When the world sees Bitcoin doing well, other currencies usually benefits, too. “The entire cryptocurrency market often moves up or down based on what’s happening with Bitcoin,” said Stewart Dennis, CEO of cryptocurrency email system . “If Bitcoin’s value continues to appreciate, that bodes well for the future of other currencies.” That may leave . Predicting the future appreciation of Bitcoin is difficult. As we have seen over the past couple of years, it can tumble back down following major world events.  from using Bitcoin in 2013 saw the currency nearly halve in value over a few weeks. Hacks of major Bitcoin exchange services, and speculative bubbles, have led to other temporary downturns in its fortunes. “If Bitcoin’s value continues to appreciate, that bodes well for the future of other currencies.” Of course, there’s always the competition looking to use one of these disruptions to make an attempt on the crown. The latest is , designed to offer larger capacity than its predecessor to reduce transaction fees. Does it stand to find success as an alternative top-tier currency where others have failed? “Anyone at any time can fork Bitcoin as it is open source,” Vortex told us, dismissively. “This is what Litecoin and many other coins did. They forked Bitcoin, tweaked a few things, and called it something else.” The only difference with Bitcoin Cash, he claims, is that it’s the first currency to attempt to use the original Bitcoin name. Although  has quickly become one of the more valuable cryptocurrencies ($400 at the time of writing), Vortex points out that it does not have much support. “It only has two developers [and] is highly centralized and controlled. The core [Bitcoin] developers want nothing to do with it,” he said. For the sake of argument, though, let’s assume Bitcoin Cash is successful, or some major calamity caused Bitcoin to fail and fall from grace. What would happen to the market then? “If Bitcoin were to fall, faith in crypto itself would be lost for many years, at least as a store of value,” Vortex told us. “As a currency however, it would still flourish. Gold is what made and broke nations for thousands of years. Digital gold, or Bitcoin, is what will make or break nations for the next thousand years.” Others, like BitBounce’s CEO, believe that the market itself would recover much more quickly, and that some other coin that would pick up the reins where Bitcoin left off. “A [Bitcoin] calamity would cause other cryptocurrencies to lose significant value in the short-term,” he said. “But in the medium to long term, it could create an opening for currencies such as Ether to become the most valuable cryptocurrency.” Although Bitcoin’s future remains a little uncertain, we can draw something from its past. As the cryptocurrency with the greatest longevity and the most proven track record, we use it to get an idea of what may happen to its younger competitors as they grow and mature. At the time of writing,  is one of the more popular, vogue currencies, and in terms of its market capital, is second only to Bitcoin, even if it does trail it by a significant margin. Though it has suffered a recent downturn in value, it reached a new high less than a month ago, peaking just shy of $400 per Ether. If we look at a graph of its growth and fall and compare that to Bitcoin’s earliest peaks in 2013, the similarities are hard to ignore. The only difference is that Ether has yet to recover in quite the same manner as Bitcoin. While there are no guarantees of such a thing happening, Bitbounce’s Dennis believes it will soon. “Bitcoin has repeatedly appreciated to an all-time high and then corrected to a lower price for a while, before eventually reaching an even greater high. I see similar trends with other younger currencies,” he told DigitalTrends. Indeed, Dennis sees those currencies one day even eclipsing that of Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is still important because it started everything and has the widest adoption. However, Bitcoin’s dominance has been fading. Before too long, I expect other currencies to become even more valuable, and have greater adoption than Bitcoin.” The outcome of other currencies is far less certain. Vortex, however, disagrees. While he believes that Bitcoin will continue to underpin cryptocurrencies and even worldwide economies in the forseeable future, the outcome of other currencies is far less certain. “Nothing is predictable,” he said, but reiterated that Bitcoin’s fortunes will be reflected in those of others currencies. While he does see that any sort of success in Bitcoin cash would be a potential indicator for more hard-fork currencies being created in the future, “that trick only works a few times” and will ultimately just bring more attention to the original currency that started it all.

    "detailContent": "   If you’ve traded Bitcoin recently, you’ll be well aware of the problem that has been gradually looming its head over the past couple of years. No,  — it’s getting expensive to send Bitcoin in a timely manner. This has been the result of the “blocks” that make up the Bitcoin “blockchain” reaching capacity and when that happens, transactions take longer, or you need to pay more to be bumped up the queue. To many, that goes against the very reason for using Bitcoin in the first place and it’s lead to different ideas about how to fix it. The one that has taken hold recently however, resulted in the hard split and the creation of Bitcoin Cash. It offers blocks eight times the size of traditional Bitcoin’s, potentially giving it much greater headroom for increased user capacity in the future. This wasn’t the original plan, as  points out. Bitcoin was instead originally slated to “soft-fork” into a new iteration which would have given it slightly increased block capacity. Without unanimous support though, the plan fell through and the harder alternative was driven through by Chinese Bitcoin firm, Bitmain, bringing Bitcoin Cash into existence. The  has been rather volatile since its unveiling. It began life with a near $600 valuation, which tumbled to close to $200 in prelaunch trading, but has since steadily recovered to $473 per Bitcoin Cash at the time of writing. Bitcoin too saw a wobble at the introduction of the new cryptocurrency, but is now steadily rising again and sits at $2,742. It’s not clear yet how successful Bitcoin Cash could be, but it certainly has the potential to become a more widely used cryptocurrency among everyday users who aren’t able to afford the heftier fees which are becoming more commonplace in Bitcoin transactions.",

    "detailContent": "   BTC-e has been operating since 2011, and over time has evolved into one of the largest  in the world. However, U.S. authorities believe much of that money was stolen and that BTC-e is implicated in a number of related crimes, including fraud, computer hacking, identity theft, tax-refund fraud, public corruption, and drug trafficking. The alleged owner of the site, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested on July 25 in Greece. He is alleged to have received funds directly via the theft of bitcoins from  prior to its closure in 2014. Some of the funds were even said to have been funneled back through Mt.Gox, using the exchange to launder its own stolen coins. As large as the Mt.Gox hack was though, it made up just a fraction of the coins that were ultimately moved through BTC-e over its lifetime.  as much as $4 billion worth of the cryptocurrency was exchanged on the platform, though the indictment doesn’t make clear if that is based on the bitcoin’s current value, which is near historic highs, or its value at the time of transfer. Another charge that U.S. authorities have levied against Vinnik and his company is that the firm was not registered as a financial services business with the U.S. Department of Treasury, and did not institute an anti-money laundering process. Both are required by federal law, adding to the extensive list of charges now levied against Vinnik. If convicted of all crimes and given anything close to maximum sentencing, he stands to spend much of the rest of his life in jail. Although the company was not located within the United States, the government’s position is that because it did business with entities within the U.S., it must still abide by federal legislation. It’s important to highlight that as with most bitcoin exchanges, there were likely to be many legitimate, non-criminal users of BTC-e, though due to the anonymous nature of the service, distinguishing its lawful activities from any unlawful activities will likely prove difficult.",

    "title": "Video Card Manufacturers Hate The Cryptocurrency Price Increases, Too | Digital Trends",
    "detailContent": "   Although  around – and often above – their suggested retail price (MSRP), they’ve skyrocketed in the last few months, sometimes more than doubling. No, this wasn’t because a surge of new gamers began trying to render gorgeous high-end games. The culprit was a fresh batch of cryptocurrency miners. Riding the wave of record cryptocurrency highs, they descended on hapless retailers like a Mongol horde, buying up every energy efficient  they could find. It left supplies destitute, and like every case of an imbalance in supply and demand, prices rose. From a gamer’s perspective, this is a disaster. If stock cannot be found because this trend continues, how will anyone be able to  when new games come out or heaven-forbid, their current graphics card dies? Fortunately, gamers are not the only ones concerned by this trend, and a number of interested parties are aiming to turn things around. “Personally, I see this as a bad thing for the industry,” one graphics card manufacturer insider told Digital Trends. “These products were made for gaming, but now they’ll be used for something that the product wasn’t designed for – running 24-hours non-stop.” Increases in component cost will always have a negative effect on business. “It’s problematic for gamers, who now face poor availability and price hikes from retailers and resellers due to supply and demand.” Ben Miles, managing director at British system builder , told us that his company had faced price rises at the supply end, which meant rising prices for gamers. “As you would expect, increases in component cost will always have a negative effect on business,” he said. “The shortages start at the cards that deliver the best bang for buck, then move onto the ones that delivers second best value, and so on, up and down the ‘cost vs compute’ bell curve.” He went on to back up  that showed mid-range cards, and those with a mix of energy efficiency and power, were the hardest hit. In other words, the most popular, affordable cards are selling out first. Some of the most powerful graphics cards may still be available, but not the ones a majority of gamers buy — a real problem. Soon, supply woes may extend far beyond mid-range cards. “Right now, the worst affected cards are AMD Radeon RX 580, 480, 470 and 570. NVIDIA cards are now also extremely affected with the 1060, 1070, 1080, and even 1050Ti in severe constraint,” Miles said. “As these cards dry up, pressure starts to be put upon cards above and below the ‘ideal’ GPUs in the product hierarchy.” Miles iterated in clear terms where Chillblast’s loyalty lies, describing the cryptocurrency market as a “persistent clinical threat” to the gaming industry. Not everyone is as against the new trend in cryptomining purchases, though. British component seller  hopes to build a middle-ground industry that caters to both gamers and miners equally. Andrew Gibson, the company’s purchasing manager, described the problem the retailer hopes to solve. “We’re happy to support the miners, but at the same time we’ve been taking care to support our gaming community too, so it is fair for everyone. We have graphics cards for gamers making sure that they are listed at just one per customer, and offered special deals for our dedicated forum members.” One insider predicted that we’ll soon see the crypto-miner demand for cards dwindle. In addition to supporting gamers, OCUK has tried to divert the miners toward cards better suited for them, rather than dam them off entirely. “We are the first to list , and high wattage power supply combos that are suitable for mining,” Gibson said. These tactics give hope that the hardware industry is on the side of gamers, and pushing towards a world where products designed for them are  for them — but, that’s not the case at every company. “We see [cryptocurrency sales] as a good thing,” one insider from a major GPU manufacturer told us. “The gaming industry has been growing every year, and now with the whole mining boom.” Although the representative did suggest that “higher management is split” on the supply issues driving up pricing, for the most part, the company appeared to be pleased with the overall uptick in sales, despite the effect it was having on gamers. A source within  had similar feelings, though they felt confident the company can support both gamers and miners in the near future. “We have very healthy demand for all our products, and although the mining business is taking a lot of boards we have responded with the specific mining [cards] to ensure we support both our gamers and the crypto currency business.” At worst, manufacturers see this as a temporary problem, with one anonymous insider predicting that we’ll soon see the crypto-miner demand for cards dwindle. “As the currencies become more difficult to mine, we will see the hobbyists losing interest due to the cost and the mining ‘professionals’ becoming more prevalent. There is a delay in matching supply with demand, but we should see in the long-term miners , and gaming products freeing up.” Nvidia and AMD need to try and do something to protect core gaming values. Perhaps that is the best future that gamers can hope for. If, in time, cryptocurrency mining becomes less profitable, miners may move on to fancier new hardware, or the industry will constrict until there are only a few huge farms making the bulk of the money from it. There is some evidence suggesting this will happen sooner rather than later.  in recent weeks. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is dealing with the  new Bitcoin, as well as the threat of a currency split. But what if the current supply issues aren’t dealt with in the coming months? As one source sources told us, the current mining boom has lasted much longer than the Bitcoin GPU mining bubble in 2014. It could crash at any time, but it hasn’t yet, and it’s not clear it will. Ben Miles at Chillblast called on AMD and Nvidia to do more to combat the problems faced by cryptocurrency miners. “Nvidia and AMD need to try and do something to protect core gaming values by making mining products available and priced less than gaming equivalents,” he said. Additional stock and more affordable, mining-focused hardware seems like the best way to combat the problem, but it’s not something that’s going to happen overnight. We may be months away from the graphics card industry returning to some semblance of normality, and that could in turn cause issues for system sellers and even game developers, as their next game may not receive the love they expected from gamers unable to affordable a new video card. For PC gamers, this is a potential doomsday scenario, and one with no immediate solution. Still, some comfort can be taken in the very stress the surge in cryptocurrency has caused. Companies want to sell cards to as many people as will buy them, both gamers and miners. That should spur them to increase orders and build even more mining-focused cards – or so we hope.",

    "detailContent": " Everyone’s been talking about Cryptocurrency for the last few weeks, and it’s not hard to see why. Bitcoin is reaching new value heights, while side projects like Lightcoin and Ethereum are beginning to gather steam and build hype. But a turning point is coming soon, and it’s going to rattle the cryptocurrency community. Before we get to that, we’ll talk about how mining for Bitcoin has created a supply shortage of mid-range GPUs, something we saw a few years ago with AMD cards as well. Miners are buying them up for their power efficiency and high hash rate, as well as their appealing sub-$200 price point. That means AIB partners have completely run out of stock, and individual users have been taking to eBay and other secondary markets to sell their GPUs for well over face price. Part of this newfound enthusiasm comes from a totally new cryptocurrency, Ethereum. It provides smart contracts that allow code to be executed when certain conditions are met. That makes transactions way easier than they would be by exchanging wallet codes and manually checking to see if the funds have arrived. Its value has stabilized since its split, something that Bitcoin may be about to experience as well. August 1st is an important date for the Bitcoin community, as transactions have become so slow, there needs to be a change in how the system works to encourage continued market permeation. It represents the next evolution of the coin, and it could take Bitcoin in several different directions. Some parties are hoping for a split that would create New Bitcoin and Bitcoin Classic, although probably not with those names. Others hope for a solution that will keep Bitcoin in one piece. Either way, it will be exciting to watch, or a nail-biting experience if you’re invested. Close to the Metal is a podcast from Digital Trends that takes a deep dive into computing and PC gaming topics. Each show, we’ll focus in on one topic, and leave no stone unturned as we show off the latest in hardware and software. Whether it’s the latest GPU, supercomputers, or which 2-in-1 you should buy, we break down the complicated jargon and talk about how user experience is affected in the real world.

We\u0026#39;ll be discussing results on the Close to the Metal podcast tomorrow.  \u0026mdash; Digital Trends (@DigitalTrends)  Mining cryptocurrency is surprisingly easy, assuming you have the proper hardware. Our handy guide to mining will walk you through all the steps necessary to start making money, if you’re so inclined. Just make sure to take into account the increase in your power bill that comes along with it. You should know, however, that cryptocurrency is a volatile market, and not just in the sense that the value can change overnight. Without much regulation, sites that act as wallets may be shut down by hackers or those interested in taking the coins for themselves, or the site’s proprietors may shut it down and disappear in the night with your hard-earned cash. There are ways around this, and they involve keeping codes locally stored, or even using a physical coin wallet that keeps your money safely stored away from the prying eyes of the Internet. It isn’t just Bitcoin that’s causing quite a stir over the last few weeks. Another cryptocurrency, , has begun to take hold thanks to some innovative new practices and support from the tech community. It’s just one of many cryptocurrency options out there, and like any of them, hype and user interest will drive its success.

The other impact is that the use of  sucks down some serious electricity and is resulting in some pretty impressive statistics, as . According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin and Ethereum mining taken together consume more power than countries like Jordan, Iceland, and Syria, with the two combined ranking 71st among all countries. This is based on  (TWh) of power and . It’s also interesting to note how Bitcoin and Ethereum mining compares in power consumption to the largest traditional financial services company, Visa. According to this statistic, the number of U.S. households that could be powered by the electricity consumed by  alone exceeds a 1.25 million. Another way to look at it is that roughly 27 times as much energy is consumed by Bitcoin mining as is consumed by the entire Visa network. Finally, Bitcoin is far more power intensive than Ethereum when looking at a single transaction, at 163 kilowatt-hours (KWh) versus 49 KWh. That means that a single Bitcoin transaction could power the typical U.S. household for roughly 5.5 days as compared to the 1.5 days of a single Ethereum transaction. Given that cryptocurrencies could potentially continue to rise in value, it’s likely that these statistics will continue to rise as well. Ethereum is working to alter its proof-of-work algorithm to reduce energy consumption, which would reduce the load on the electrical grid. However, Bitcoin is more amenable to industrialization while Ethereum mining favors GPU-based systems. That means that you have Ethereum to blame for your difficulty in buying that new GPU, while Bitcoin is more likely to put more of a burden on your local electric company.",
